Additionally, adjustment for employment grade had little effect on the magnitude of the association between CHD and psychological distress. 
In order to take this work further it is necessary to understand what the GHQ is measuring that increases the risk of CHD. It is possible that the GHQ is identifying fatigue and malaise indicating subclinical cardiac illness, which might be an antecedent of overt CHD. On the contrary, the 30-item GHQ was originally derived from the 60-item GHQ in order to eliminate contamination by physical illness. Also the GHQ was developed to screen for psychiatric disorder and scores on the GHQ are correlated with clinical psychiatric disorder and depression.17,23,24 It might be that although the GHQ is not measuring subclinical physical illness it is identifying psychological distress that has arisen as a consequence of subclinical physical illness although this seems unlikely in the relatively young population at baseline in whom those with existing CHD were excluded from these analyses and in whom younger men were more at risk of CHD related to psychological distress than older men. 
If it is accepted that a psychological factor rather than physical illness-related factor is the key element of increased risk, it is still not clear from our analyses whether it might be depressive symptoms or depressive illness that are responsible for increased CHD risk. A recent study suggests that experience of clinical depressive illness is associated with increased CHD risk25 and this seems plausible as major depressive illnesses are associated with raised cortisol levels26 and physical symptoms, and might be expected to be associated with metabolic disturbance increasing coronary risk. Nevertheless, most studies have found that less severe depression, namely depressive symptoms, is predictive of CHD. The GHQ screens for both depressive illness and lesser levels of both depression and anxiety. It may be that persistence of depressive symptoms over long periods of time is more important in the pathogenesis of CHD than shorter episodes of severe depressive illness.

Elucidation of the mechanisms of these associations has implications for prevention. This study aims to confirm the association between psychological distress and CHD and examine if it could be explained by other factors such as health behaviours, social isolation and low control at work. \r\nMethods A prospective occupational cohort study of London-based civil service employees (Whitehall II Study) with baseline data collected from 1985\x961988 with a 5-year follow-up. The participants were male and female middle-aged civil servants working in 20 Government Departments; 73% of eligible employees attended baseline screening. Psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at baseline was used to predict incidence of self-reported CHD and possible and probable electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during follow-up. \r\nResults In men, baseline psychological distress was associated with an increased incidence of overall self-reported CHD (odds ratios [OR] = 1.83, 95% CI : 1.5\x962.3) and ECG abnormalities (OR = 1.51, 95% CI : 1', '.1\x962.1), after adjustment for age, employment grade and length of follow-up. In women, baseline psychological distress was also associated with an increased incidence of CHD (OR = 1.60, 95% CI : 1.2\x962.1), but not with ECG abnormalities. Adjustment for health behaviours, marital status, social networks and work characteristics reduced the risks for incident CHD by 12% in men and by 10% in women; for ECG abnormalities these adjustments increased the risk in men by 16% and had little effect in women. \r\nConclusions The experience of psychological distress confers increased risk of CHD in men that is not explained by health behaviours, social isolation or work characteristics. The increased risk of CHD associated with psychological distress is not consistently demonstrated in women. \r\n        \r\n\t        \r\n        \t\r\n        \r\n        \r\nKeywords Depression, anxiety disorders, coronary disease, epidemiology\r\nAccepted  9 August 2001\r\nPsychological distress, particularly depression, is being increasingly recognized as a risk factor for incident coronary heart disease (CHD).1\x967 Depression is also associated with increased mortality risk following myocardial infarction.8,9 Its emergence as a major CHD risk factor has been relatively recent although for some time it has been recognized as a background risk factor,10 among a cluster of other psychosocial factors with a negative connotation, namely hostility, low control at work, negative life events and social isolation.11 There has been little work exploring how these psychosocial factors might relate to the association between psychological distress and CHD risk. \r\nThere are several potential pathways for the effect of psychological distress on CHD. First, psychological distress may be indirectly associated with CHD through associations with the adoption of unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, eating fatty foods or drinking alcohol excessively, or lack of exercise,12 which in themselves increase the risk of CHD. Second, social isolation may be a behavioural consequence of psychological distress, and an intervening factor between psychological distress and CHD.13 Third, psychological distress may be an outcome of exposure to situations of low perceived control both at work and home, associated with lower socioeconomic status. Thus, if low control at work predisposes to CHD,14 psychological distress may', ' either be an intervening factor on the pathway to CHD or an index of low control or low socioeconomic position related directly to CHD risk. Fourth, psychological distress may have a direct effect on CHD independent of these other behavioural and psychosocial factors, mediated either by neurohumoral activation related to catecholamine secretion or hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis activation and secondary metabolic disturbance. These negative mood states and environmental conditions might all act through a single pathway or these factors might have independent effects on CHD risk. \r\nThis paper uses data from a prospective occupational cohort study, the Whitehall II Study, of middle-aged civil servants to test whether the increased CHD risk associated with psychological distress can be explained by health-related behaviours and psychosocial factors: social isolation and low control at work. Our prior hypothesis was that psychological distress, independently of other negatively-connoted risk factors, would be associated prospectively with increased CHD risk. Psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at Phase 1 (1985\x961988), was used to predict the incidence of CHD over a 5-year period. \r\nMethod\r\nSample\r\nThe Whitehall II Study was set up in 1985 to investigate the causes of the social gradient in morbidity and mortality and included work characteristics and social networks as potential explanations of this gradient. All male and female civil servants, aged between 35 and 55 years in 20 London-based civil service departments were invited to a screening examination, including measurement of blood pressure, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood sample (Phase 1: 1985\x961988). The overall response rate was 73% (74% for men and 71% for women). The true response rates are likely to be higher as around 4% of those on the list of employees moved before the study and thus were ineligible for inclusion. Altogether 10 308 civil servants were examined at baseline\x976895 men (67%) and 3413 women (33%). A postal questionnaire was carried out in 1989 (Phase 2) and the participants had a further screening examination (Phase 3: 1991\x961993). The length of follow-up between Phase 1 and Phase 3 was 5.3 years on average (range 3.7\x967.6). Data on psychosocial factors, health behaviours and medical history were collected by self-report questionnaire at all three phases. Details of the screening examination are reported elsewhere.15 \r\nOf the 10 308', "" participants at baseline, 10 189 had data on psychological distress at baseline. Of these, 582 men and 313 women had self-reported CHD at baseline and were excluded. Of the 9294 participants, a further 139 were excluded because of missing CHD data at Phase 1. Participants were only included if they had complete CHD data at Phase 2 and Phase 3. Thus 2383 participants (1516 men and 867 women) did not complete questionnaires for either Phase 2 or 3 and 199 had uninterpretable data and were also excluded. The remaining 6573 participants (4538 men, 2035 women) were free of CHD at baseline and had incident self-reported CHD status available at Phase 2 or Phase 3. Similarly, 414 men and 239 women had an abnormal ECG data at baseline and were excluded. There were 7503 participants (5238 men and 2265 women) with baseline psychological distress measures who had a normal ECG reading at baseline and on whom incident ECG data were available; the number of participants available with complete data on covariates was 6269 (4374 men, 1895 women) for incident CHD analyses and 7081 (5040 men, 2041 women) for the incident ECG analyses. \r\nEmployment grade\r\nThe Civil Service identifies 12 non-industrial grades on the basis of salary. There is a steep increment in salaries from an annual salary in 1987 of between £3061\x96£5841 in the clerical and office support grades to between £18 020\x96£62 100 the unified grades 1\x966. Besides the steep increment in salaries there were also marked differences in socioeconomic indicators (education, housing tenure, car ownership and father's occupation) by grade of employment.15 \r\nPsychological distress\r\nPsychological distress was measured at each of the three phases by the 30-item GHQ16 which was validated against the Clinical Interview in a sub-sample.17 A threshold of 4/5 on the GHQ was chosen on the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis. At this threshold the sensitivity of the GHQ was 73% and specificity was 78% against the Clinical Interview Schedule. The GHQ is a well-established screening questionnaire for non-psychotic psychological distress, largely depression, suitable for use in general population studies. All those scoring 0\x964 on the GHQ at Phase 1 were considered \x91non-cases' and those scoring 5+ were considered \x91cases'. \r\nCoronary heart"", "" disease and risk factors\r\nThree self-reported indicators of CHD were combined into a single measure of self-reported incident CHD: angina pectoris, severe pain across the chest that lasted half an hour or more from the London School of Hygiene Chest Pain Questionnaire,18 and doctor-diagnosed ischaemia (i.e. a participant's report that a doctor had diagnosed or suspected a heart attack or angina pectoris). To be included as a new case, a participant had to have been free of disease at Phase 1, but to respond positively to one or more of the categories at Phase 2 or Phase 3. A separate measure of ECG abnormalities (i.e. incident ECG abnormalities) at Phase 3 was used as an objective indicator of new CHD. Incident ECG abnormalities included the presence of Q waves with Minnesota codes 1\x961 to 1\x962 (probable ischaemia); any Q wave with codes 1\x961 to 1\x963, S-T or T waves (codes 4\x961 to 4\x964 or 5\x961 to 5\x963) or left bundle branch block (code 7\x961\x961) (possible ischaemia). For each of these outcomes, subjects who were positive at Phase 1 were excluded from analyses. \r\nCoronary risk factors\r\nCoronary risk factors and health-related behaviours were measured in standard ways: smoking status (never, former, current, pipe or cigars only [men only]), body-mass index (kg/m2), and physical activity (1 h vigorous activity per week, <1 h vigorous activity but 1 h moderate activity per week, <1 h vigorous or moderate activity per week). Alcohol intake was measured in units per week and subdivided into categories: none, 1\x9614, 15\x9621, 22+ units, with the highest two categories being combined in women. A healthy diet consisted of wholemeal, granary or wheatmeal bread, skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, and fresh fruits or vegetables at least once daily. An unhealthy diet consisted of other types of bread and milk and less frequent consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables. Eating habits were coded from 0 (unhealthy diet) to 3 (healthy diet). \r\nPsychosocial work characteristics\r\nJob control and psychological job demands based on two of the dimensions in Karasek's Job Content Instrument19 were measured by a self-"", ""completion questionnaire at Phase 1. Fifteen items deal with decision authority and skill discretion and these were combined into an index of decision latitude. \r\nSocial networks\r\nThe social network measures were summarized by a scale that measured the network beyond the household; this includes both frequency of contact and number of contacts with friends and relatives and participation in social groups.20 \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nThe longitudinal relations between psychological distress and subsequent CHD incidence were examined using logistic regression. This allowed the effects of psychological distress (GHQ caseness) to be expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their 95% CI relative to non-cases. In all analyses we controlled for the confounding effects of age and employment grade and also included a term for each individual's length of follow-up between Phase 1 and Phase 3. In order to assess the confounding effects of other factors, we selected the subset of subjects without any missing values and fitted further models just on these subjects. The magnitude of the confounding effects was assessed by calculating the proportion of the excess risk (OR minus 1.0) explained when fitting these terms in the model. The associations of GHQ caseness and the other factors on CHD incidence among this subset of subjects were compared, where possible, with the associations among the subjects who had been excluded because of missing values. These two datasets showed similar associations for most of the factors. \r\nResults\r\nA quarter of men and nearly a third of women scored above the threshold on the GHQ at baseline and were considered possible cases of psychiatric disorder manifesting significant psychological distress (Table 1). These percentages only differed minimally when analyses were restricted to those with incident data. Women reported more incident CHD events at follow-up than men although ECG abnormalities were more common in men than women (Table 1). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 1  Percentages (number of occurrences/number of subjects) of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) caseness at baseline, self-reported incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and possible or probable incident electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities\r\n\xa0\r\nPsychological distress at Phase 1 was associated with increased risk of new reports of CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 in both men and women, adjusting for age, employment grade and length of follow-up (Table 2). General Health Questionnaire caseness at baseline increased the odds of CHD by 83"", '% in men and 60% in women (Table 2). In men, GHQ caseness was also associated with the development of new possible and probable ECG abnormalities at Phase 3 (Table 2). This was not found in women, where, if anything, psychological distress at Phase 1 was associated with lower risk of ECG abnormalities at Phase 3. Younger men, less than 45 years, had a higher risk of new possible and probable ECG abnormalities than older men (men <45, OR = 2.03, 95% CI : 1.2\x963.3; men 45 OR = 1.20, 95% CI : 0.8\x961.9). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 2  Odds ratioa (95% CI) for self-reported incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and possible or probable incident electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities by General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nCovariate factors were chosen as either confounding or mediating factors in the association between psychological distress and CHD on the basis of a prior association with CHD or depression in the research literature. Age-adjusted associations between GHQ caseness and the covariate factors are reported in Table 3. In men, divorce, current smoking status, moderate or little physical activity, low levels of social contacts, low decision latitude and high job demands were all significantly associated with GHQ caseness (Table 3). In women, divorce, high alcohol intake, low social contacts, and high job demands were all significantly associated with GHQ caseness. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 3  Age-adjusted associations (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with General Health Questionnaire caseness\r\n\xa0\r\nAge-adjusted associations between covariates at baseline and self-reported incident CHD at follow-up are reported in Table 4. In men, current smoking, lack of physical activity, higher body mass index, low social networks and low control at work were associated significantly (P < 0.05) with increased coronary risk. In women, widowhood, higher body mass index, medium and low decision latitude and high job demands were associated with increased coronary risk. In men, moderate alcohol intake and, in women, single status, were associated with', ' reduced coronary risk. In relation to incident possible/probable ECG abnormalities, current smoking and higher body mass index were related significantly to increased risk in men but not women where there were no clear associations (Table 5). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 4  Age-adjusted associations (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with self-reported incident coronary heart disease\r\n\xa0\r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 5  Association (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with possible/probable electrocardiographic abnormalities\r\n\xa0\r\nCould these associations between psychological distress and incidence of CHD be explained by existing risk factors for CHD, namely health-related behaviours, social isolation or work characteristics? The risk of new reports of CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 by GHQ caseness at Phase 1 is changed minimally after adjusting for health behaviours in men and women (Table 6). Adjustment for marital status, social networks and work characteristics made only about a 5% change in men but reduced the excess risk by about a quarter in women. Full adjustment for health behaviours, marital status, social networks and work characteristics simultaneously, in addition to age, employment grade and length of employment reduces the excess risk of new reports of CHD by about 10% in men and by just under a quarter in women. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 6  Odds ratiosa (95% CI) for self-reported incident CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 associated with General Health Questionnaire caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nIn men, considering an objective index of CHD, possible and probable ECG abnormalities, adjustment for health behaviours minimally diminished the risk associated with psychological distress of developing ECG abnormalities by Phase 3 (Table 7). Adjustment for marital status, social networks and work characteristics simultaneously increased the risk, with the OR for ECG abnormalities being 1.54 (P = 0.016). In women there was no statistically significant increased risk of ECG abnormalities either before or after adjustment for the risk factors. In general, there is a clear increased risk of CHD associated with psychological distress in men which is not explained by other known psychosocial risk factors for CHD. There was no', ' change in the pattern of results when these analyses were repeated on a dataset with no missing observations for both self-reported CHD and ECG abnormalities. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 7  Odds ratiosa (95% CI) for possible or probable incident electrocardiographic abnormalities at Phase 3 associated with General Health Questionnaire caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nDiscussion\r\nPsychological distress at baseline is predictive of self-reported incident CHD and possible and probable ECG abnormalities in men. The associations are less robust in women and are absent for ECG abnormalities. Health-related behaviours, social networks and control at work, despite associations with psychological distress and some associations with CHD, explain only a small part of the association between psychological distress and CHD. \r\nIt is possible that associations between psychological distress and self-reported outcomes like angina pectoris and severe pain across the chest are confounded by negative affectivity, so-called plaintive set, influencing questionnaire response style21 in which there is a tendency to report negatively on both risk factors and outcomes. This might explain why the association between psychological distress and self-reported CHD is stronger than the association between psychological distress and ECG abnormalities. Nevertheless, the GHQ is a measure of relatively transient psychological distress in most cases and is not a trait measure of neuroticism that might contribute to a negative response style which, for the purpose of this argument, would have had to remain stable over a 5-year follow up period. It is harder to argue that the association between psychological distress and a patho-physiological indicator of CHD, i.e. possible and probable ECG abnormalities, is all due to negative affectivity. Although negative affectivity might influence psychological distress it cannot influence the measurement of ECG abnormalities in a cohort study. At baseline there was no association between high GHQ scores and ECG abnormalities,22 although angina pectoris was associated with higher GHQ scores. This could be due to some selection out of the baseline sample of people with both psychological distress and CHD from among eligible participants, but does not support psychological distress as a consequence of ECG abnormalities in the absence of accompanying symptoms. \r\nAnother possibility might be that psychological distress is an indicator of low socioeconomic position and that the association between psychological distress and CHD could be explained through an association with socioeconomic position. This seems unlikely as GHQ scores do not', ' show a strong association with socioeconomic position measured by employment grade17 and although the confounding might relate to another indicator of social position, employment grade is a precise indicator of income and status in the Civil Service. Additionally, adjustment for employment grade had little effect on the magnitude of the association between CHD and psychological distress. \r\nIn order to take this work further it is necessary to understand what the GHQ is measuring that increases the risk of CHD. It is possible that the GHQ is identifying fatigue and malaise indicating subclinical cardiac illness, which might be an antecedent of overt CHD. On the contrary, the 30-item GHQ was originally derived from the 60-item GHQ in order to eliminate contamination by physical illness. Also the GHQ was developed to screen for psychiatric disorder and scores on the GHQ are correlated with clinical psychiatric disorder and depression.17,23,24 It might be that although the GHQ is not measuring subclinical physical illness it is identifying psychological distress that has arisen as a consequence of subclinical physical illness although this seems unlikely in the relatively young population at baseline in whom those with existing CHD were excluded from these analyses and in whom younger men were more at risk of CHD related to psychological distress than older men. \r\nIf it is accepted that a psychological factor rather than physical illness-related factor is the key element of increased risk, it is still not clear from our analyses whether it might be depressive symptoms or depressive illness that are responsible for increased CHD risk. A recent study suggests that experience of clinical depressive illness is associated with increased CHD risk25 and this seems plausible as major depressive illnesses are associated with raised cortisol levels26 and physical symptoms, and might be expected to be associated with metabolic disturbance increasing coronary risk. Nevertheless, most studies have found that less severe depression, namely depressive symptoms, is predictive of CHD. The GHQ screens for both depressive illness and lesser levels of both depression and anxiety. It may be that persistence of depressive symptoms over long periods of time is more important in the pathogenesis of CHD than shorter episodes of severe depressive illness. Anda2 has suggested that both severity of depression, and chronicity may be important in determining CHD risk. If psychological distress increases CHD risk through long-term pathophysiological processes such as atherosclerosis then it would seem likely that distress may be a marker for a persistent trait such as hopelessness7 or pessimism27 which have been linked to increased mortality risk. A shorter term risk associated with psychological', "" distress would be more in keeping with underlying processes such as increased susceptibility to arrhythmia's or influences on thrombogenesis or inflammation. \r\nHealth-related behaviours, particularly smoking,28 alcohol use, high fat diet and lack of exercise have been associated both with psychological distress and CHD. The plausible hypothesis that the effects of psychological distress are mediated though health behaviours is not supported by our results. Similarly, in another longitudinal study depression predicted CHD but was not associated with physical activity or smoking.25 \r\nSocial isolation, measured by social network analysis predicts CHD morbidity and mortality in many studies.29 Low social support has also been related to decreased survival post-myocardial infarction.30,31 Depression and social relations have been found to have independent effects on all-cause mortality in a French community study32 suggesting that the risk of depression on mortality risk is not mediated by social isolation. It could be that low social support might precede psychological distress on the pathway to CHD. Although low social support may contribute to the causation of psychological distress and hence to CHD in this cohort, it does not seem to explain the association between psychological distress and CHD. Alternatively, psychological distress could be an antecedent of low social support but other analyses in this cohort do not support this. Although we have reported that low control in the workplace predicts CHD,14 as well as psychiatric morbidity,33 it does not seem to explain the psychological distress-CHD association. Moreover, the effect of low control on CHD risk is independent of GHQ score.34 The results reported in this paper suggest that psychological distress has an independent effect on CHD risk which is not explained by psychosocial risk factors for CHD. \r\nWhy does this association between depression and CHD, also found in other studies, appear to be more consistent in men than women?5 Recent reports from the NHANES I Study found that depressive symptoms predicted CHD incidence in both men and women. However, effects differed for mortality where depressive symptoms predicted CHD mortality in men but not in women.6 Similarly, an increased all-cause mortality risk associated with neurotic depression was confined to men in the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly although increased mortality associated with psychotic depression was found in both men and women.35 \r\nWomen have a higher prevalence of depression in the general population and also a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and new CHD in this study, but a lower prevalence of ECG abnormalities"", '. In women there are increased risks for the self-report outcomes, but not for the ECG abnormalities. It may be that this discrepancy, and the higher rates of self-reported coronary outcomes in women, are the result of a greater tendency to symptom reporting with higher rates of false positive CHD outcomes than in men.36 A further reason why women do not have increased coronary risk associated with depression may be due to pre-menopausal hormonal influences which exert a protective influence against CHD. However, it is paradoxical that during this period of the lifespan women have increased vulnerability to depression relative to men. Alternatively, women may deal more constructively with depression than men, talking about their feelings and seeking help which may neutralize the toxic potential of depression to cause CHD. \r\nOur study is limited by our current reliance on broad questionnaire measures of psychological distress and depression and self-report measures of incident CHD, although ECG abnormalities provide an objective estimate of CHD. We are currently collecting hospital and general practitioner records of CHD events and are measuring depression by interview to address this. The GHQ as a non-specific screening tool for psychological distress could be a marker for early decline in physical functioning, which may be a risk factor for CHD. However, removal of prevalent cases of CHD from these prospective analyses makes this less likely. It is possible that health behaviours such as smoking and alcohol consumption assessed by self-report underestimate consumption and therefore underestimate risk. This may be especially the case for assessment of alcohol intake. Nevertheless, studies find agreement between some self-report and objective indices of health behaviours, for instance cotinine and smoking,37 suggesting that certain of our self-report measures may be accurate indicators of behaviour. \r\nAlthough the Whitehall II cohort is an office-based occupational cohort there seems no reason why these results should not generalize to the population at large. Altogether, the results of this study support the existing evidence that psychological distress is a risk factor for CHD, in men, if not in women. Further research is needed to identify which aspects of psychological distress are toxic to the heart. \r\n \r\nAcknowledgments\r\nWe thank all participating civil service departments and their welfare, personnel and establishment officers; the Occupational Health and Safety Agency; the Council of Civil Service Unions; all participating civil servants in the Whitehall II study; and all members of the Whitehall II study team.

Elucidation of the mechanisms of these associations has implications for prevention. This study aims to confirm the association between psychological distress and CHD and examine if it could be explained by other factors such as health behaviours, social isolation and low control at work. \r\nMethods A prospective occupational cohort study of London-based civil service employees (Whitehall II Study) with baseline data collected from 1985\x961988 with a 5-year follow-up. The participants were male and female middle-aged civil servants working in 20 Government Departments; 73% of eligible employees attended baseline screening. Psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at baseline was used to predict incidence of self-reported CHD and possible and probable electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during follow-up. \r\nResults In men, baseline psychological distress was associated with an increased incidence of overall self-reported CHD (odds ratios [OR] = 1.83, 95% CI : 1.5\x962.3) and ECG abnormalities (OR = 1.51, 95% CI : 1', '.1\x962.1), after adjustment for age, employment grade and length of follow-up. In women, baseline psychological distress was also associated with an increased incidence of CHD (OR = 1.60, 95% CI : 1.2\x962.1), but not with ECG abnormalities. Adjustment for health behaviours, marital status, social networks and work characteristics reduced the risks for incident CHD by 12% in men and by 10% in women; for ECG abnormalities these adjustments increased the risk in men by 16% and had little effect in women. \r\nConclusions The experience of psychological distress confers increased risk of CHD in men that is not explained by health behaviours, social isolation or work characteristics. The increased risk of CHD associated with psychological distress is not consistently demonstrated in women. \r\n        \r\n\t        \r\n        \t\r\n        \r\n        \r\nKeywords Depression, anxiety disorders, coronary disease, epidemiology\r\nAccepted  9 August 2001\r\nPsychological distress, particularly depression, is being increasingly recognized as a risk factor for incident coronary heart disease (CHD).1\x967 Depression is also associated with increased mortality risk following myocardial infarction.8,9 Its emergence as a major CHD risk factor has been relatively recent although for some time it has been recognized as a background risk factor,10 among a cluster of other psychosocial factors with a negative connotation, namely hostility, low control at work, negative life events and social isolation.11 There has been little work exploring how these psychosocial factors might relate to the association between psychological distress and CHD risk. \r\nThere are several potential pathways for the effect of psychological distress on CHD. First, psychological distress may be indirectly associated with CHD through associations with the adoption of unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, eating fatty foods or drinking alcohol excessively, or lack of exercise,12 which in themselves increase the risk of CHD. Second, social isolation may be a behavioural consequence of psychological distress, and an intervening factor between psychological distress and CHD.13 Third, psychological distress may be an outcome of exposure to situations of low perceived control both at work and home, associated with lower socioeconomic status. Thus, if low control at work predisposes to CHD,14 psychological distress may', ' either be an intervening factor on the pathway to CHD or an index of low control or low socioeconomic position related directly to CHD risk. Fourth, psychological distress may have a direct effect on CHD independent of these other behavioural and psychosocial factors, mediated either by neurohumoral activation related to catecholamine secretion or hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis activation and secondary metabolic disturbance. These negative mood states and environmental conditions might all act through a single pathway or these factors might have independent effects on CHD risk. \r\nThis paper uses data from a prospective occupational cohort study, the Whitehall II Study, of middle-aged civil servants to test whether the increased CHD risk associated with psychological distress can be explained by health-related behaviours and psychosocial factors: social isolation and low control at work. Our prior hypothesis was that psychological distress, independently of other negatively-connoted risk factors, would be associated prospectively with increased CHD risk. Psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at Phase 1 (1985\x961988), was used to predict the incidence of CHD over a 5-year period. \r\nMethod\r\nSample\r\nThe Whitehall II Study was set up in 1985 to investigate the causes of the social gradient in morbidity and mortality and included work characteristics and social networks as potential explanations of this gradient. All male and female civil servants, aged between 35 and 55 years in 20 London-based civil service departments were invited to a screening examination, including measurement of blood pressure, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood sample (Phase 1: 1985\x961988). The overall response rate was 73% (74% for men and 71% for women). The true response rates are likely to be higher as around 4% of those on the list of employees moved before the study and thus were ineligible for inclusion. Altogether 10 308 civil servants were examined at baseline\x976895 men (67%) and 3413 women (33%). A postal questionnaire was carried out in 1989 (Phase 2) and the participants had a further screening examination (Phase 3: 1991\x961993). The length of follow-up between Phase 1 and Phase 3 was 5.3 years on average (range 3.7\x967.6). Data on psychosocial factors, health behaviours and medical history were collected by self-report questionnaire at all three phases. Details of the screening examination are reported elsewhere.15 \r\nOf the 10 308', "" participants at baseline, 10 189 had data on psychological distress at baseline. Of these, 582 men and 313 women had self-reported CHD at baseline and were excluded. Of the 9294 participants, a further 139 were excluded because of missing CHD data at Phase 1. Participants were only included if they had complete CHD data at Phase 2 and Phase 3. Thus 2383 participants (1516 men and 867 women) did not complete questionnaires for either Phase 2 or 3 and 199 had uninterpretable data and were also excluded. The remaining 6573 participants (4538 men, 2035 women) were free of CHD at baseline and had incident self-reported CHD status available at Phase 2 or Phase 3. Similarly, 414 men and 239 women had an abnormal ECG data at baseline and were excluded. There were 7503 participants (5238 men and 2265 women) with baseline psychological distress measures who had a normal ECG reading at baseline and on whom incident ECG data were available; the number of participants available with complete data on covariates was 6269 (4374 men, 1895 women) for incident CHD analyses and 7081 (5040 men, 2041 women) for the incident ECG analyses. \r\nEmployment grade\r\nThe Civil Service identifies 12 non-industrial grades on the basis of salary. There is a steep increment in salaries from an annual salary in 1987 of between £3061\x96£5841 in the clerical and office support grades to between £18 020\x96£62 100 the unified grades 1\x966. Besides the steep increment in salaries there were also marked differences in socioeconomic indicators (education, housing tenure, car ownership and father's occupation) by grade of employment.15 \r\nPsychological distress\r\nPsychological distress was measured at each of the three phases by the 30-item GHQ16 which was validated against the Clinical Interview in a sub-sample.17 A threshold of 4/5 on the GHQ was chosen on the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis. At this threshold the sensitivity of the GHQ was 73% and specificity was 78% against the Clinical Interview Schedule. The GHQ is a well-established screening questionnaire for non-psychotic psychological distress, largely depression, suitable for use in general population studies. All those scoring 0\x964 on the GHQ at Phase 1 were considered \x91non-cases' and those scoring 5+ were considered \x91cases'. \r\nCoronary heart"", "" disease and risk factors\r\nThree self-reported indicators of CHD were combined into a single measure of self-reported incident CHD: angina pectoris, severe pain across the chest that lasted half an hour or more from the London School of Hygiene Chest Pain Questionnaire,18 and doctor-diagnosed ischaemia (i.e. a participant's report that a doctor had diagnosed or suspected a heart attack or angina pectoris). To be included as a new case, a participant had to have been free of disease at Phase 1, but to respond positively to one or more of the categories at Phase 2 or Phase 3. A separate measure of ECG abnormalities (i.e. incident ECG abnormalities) at Phase 3 was used as an objective indicator of new CHD. Incident ECG abnormalities included the presence of Q waves with Minnesota codes 1\x961 to 1\x962 (probable ischaemia); any Q wave with codes 1\x961 to 1\x963, S-T or T waves (codes 4\x961 to 4\x964 or 5\x961 to 5\x963) or left bundle branch block (code 7\x961\x961) (possible ischaemia). For each of these outcomes, subjects who were positive at Phase 1 were excluded from analyses. \r\nCoronary risk factors\r\nCoronary risk factors and health-related behaviours were measured in standard ways: smoking status (never, former, current, pipe or cigars only [men only]), body-mass index (kg/m2), and physical activity (1 h vigorous activity per week, <1 h vigorous activity but 1 h moderate activity per week, <1 h vigorous or moderate activity per week). Alcohol intake was measured in units per week and subdivided into categories: none, 1\x9614, 15\x9621, 22+ units, with the highest two categories being combined in women. A healthy diet consisted of wholemeal, granary or wheatmeal bread, skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, and fresh fruits or vegetables at least once daily. An unhealthy diet consisted of other types of bread and milk and less frequent consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables. Eating habits were coded from 0 (unhealthy diet) to 3 (healthy diet). \r\nPsychosocial work characteristics\r\nJob control and psychological job demands based on two of the dimensions in Karasek's Job Content Instrument19 were measured by a self-"", ""completion questionnaire at Phase 1. Fifteen items deal with decision authority and skill discretion and these were combined into an index of decision latitude. \r\nSocial networks\r\nThe social network measures were summarized by a scale that measured the network beyond the household; this includes both frequency of contact and number of contacts with friends and relatives and participation in social groups.20 \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nThe longitudinal relations between psychological distress and subsequent CHD incidence were examined using logistic regression. This allowed the effects of psychological distress (GHQ caseness) to be expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their 95% CI relative to non-cases. In all analyses we controlled for the confounding effects of age and employment grade and also included a term for each individual's length of follow-up between Phase 1 and Phase 3. In order to assess the confounding effects of other factors, we selected the subset of subjects without any missing values and fitted further models just on these subjects. The magnitude of the confounding effects was assessed by calculating the proportion of the excess risk (OR minus 1.0) explained when fitting these terms in the model. The associations of GHQ caseness and the other factors on CHD incidence among this subset of subjects were compared, where possible, with the associations among the subjects who had been excluded because of missing values. These two datasets showed similar associations for most of the factors. \r\nResults\r\nA quarter of men and nearly a third of women scored above the threshold on the GHQ at baseline and were considered possible cases of psychiatric disorder manifesting significant psychological distress (Table 1). These percentages only differed minimally when analyses were restricted to those with incident data. Women reported more incident CHD events at follow-up than men although ECG abnormalities were more common in men than women (Table 1). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 1  Percentages (number of occurrences/number of subjects) of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) caseness at baseline, self-reported incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and possible or probable incident electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities\r\n\xa0\r\nPsychological distress at Phase 1 was associated with increased risk of new reports of CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 in both men and women, adjusting for age, employment grade and length of follow-up (Table 2). General Health Questionnaire caseness at baseline increased the odds of CHD by 83"", '% in men and 60% in women (Table 2). In men, GHQ caseness was also associated with the development of new possible and probable ECG abnormalities at Phase 3 (Table 2). This was not found in women, where, if anything, psychological distress at Phase 1 was associated with lower risk of ECG abnormalities at Phase 3. Younger men, less than 45 years, had a higher risk of new possible and probable ECG abnormalities than older men (men <45, OR = 2.03, 95% CI : 1.2\x963.3; men 45 OR = 1.20, 95% CI : 0.8\x961.9). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 2  Odds ratioa (95% CI) for self-reported incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and possible or probable incident electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities by General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nCovariate factors were chosen as either confounding or mediating factors in the association between psychological distress and CHD on the basis of a prior association with CHD or depression in the research literature. Age-adjusted associations between GHQ caseness and the covariate factors are reported in Table 3. In men, divorce, current smoking status, moderate or little physical activity, low levels of social contacts, low decision latitude and high job demands were all significantly associated with GHQ caseness (Table 3). In women, divorce, high alcohol intake, low social contacts, and high job demands were all significantly associated with GHQ caseness. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 3  Age-adjusted associations (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with General Health Questionnaire caseness\r\n\xa0\r\nAge-adjusted associations between covariates at baseline and self-reported incident CHD at follow-up are reported in Table 4. In men, current smoking, lack of physical activity, higher body mass index, low social networks and low control at work were associated significantly (P < 0.05) with increased coronary risk. In women, widowhood, higher body mass index, medium and low decision latitude and high job demands were associated with increased coronary risk. In men, moderate alcohol intake and, in women, single status, were associated with', ' reduced coronary risk. In relation to incident possible/probable ECG abnormalities, current smoking and higher body mass index were related significantly to increased risk in men but not women where there were no clear associations (Table 5). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 4  Age-adjusted associations (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with self-reported incident coronary heart disease\r\n\xa0\r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 5  Association (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with possible/probable electrocardiographic abnormalities\r\n\xa0\r\nCould these associations between psychological distress and incidence of CHD be explained by existing risk factors for CHD, namely health-related behaviours, social isolation or work characteristics? The risk of new reports of CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 by GHQ caseness at Phase 1 is changed minimally after adjusting for health behaviours in men and women (Table 6). Adjustment for marital status, social networks and work characteristics made only about a 5% change in men but reduced the excess risk by about a quarter in women. Full adjustment for health behaviours, marital status, social networks and work characteristics simultaneously, in addition to age, employment grade and length of employment reduces the excess risk of new reports of CHD by about 10% in men and by just under a quarter in women. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 6  Odds ratiosa (95% CI) for self-reported incident CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 associated with General Health Questionnaire caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nIn men, considering an objective index of CHD, possible and probable ECG abnormalities, adjustment for health behaviours minimally diminished the risk associated with psychological distress of developing ECG abnormalities by Phase 3 (Table 7). Adjustment for marital status, social networks and work characteristics simultaneously increased the risk, with the OR for ECG abnormalities being 1.54 (P = 0.016). In women there was no statistically significant increased risk of ECG abnormalities either before or after adjustment for the risk factors. In general, there is a clear increased risk of CHD associated with psychological distress in men which is not explained by other known psychosocial risk factors for CHD. There was no', ' change in the pattern of results when these analyses were repeated on a dataset with no missing observations for both self-reported CHD and ECG abnormalities. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 7  Odds ratiosa (95% CI) for possible or probable incident electrocardiographic abnormalities at Phase 3 associated with General Health Questionnaire caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nDiscussion\r\nPsychological distress at baseline is predictive of self-reported incident CHD and possible and probable ECG abnormalities in men. The associations are less robust in women and are absent for ECG abnormalities. Health-related behaviours, social networks and control at work, despite associations with psychological distress and some associations with CHD, explain only a small part of the association between psychological distress and CHD. \r\nIt is possible that associations between psychological distress and self-reported outcomes like angina pectoris and severe pain across the chest are confounded by negative affectivity, so-called plaintive set, influencing questionnaire response style21 in which there is a tendency to report negatively on both risk factors and outcomes. This might explain why the association between psychological distress and self-reported CHD is stronger than the association between psychological distress and ECG abnormalities. Nevertheless, the GHQ is a measure of relatively transient psychological distress in most cases and is not a trait measure of neuroticism that might contribute to a negative response style which, for the purpose of this argument, would have had to remain stable over a 5-year follow up period. It is harder to argue that the association between psychological distress and a patho-physiological indicator of CHD, i.e. possible and probable ECG abnormalities, is all due to negative affectivity. Although negative affectivity might influence psychological distress it cannot influence the measurement of ECG abnormalities in a cohort study. At baseline there was no association between high GHQ scores and ECG abnormalities,22 although angina pectoris was associated with higher GHQ scores. This could be due to some selection out of the baseline sample of people with both psychological distress and CHD from among eligible participants, but does not support psychological distress as a consequence of ECG abnormalities in the absence of accompanying symptoms. \r\nAnother possibility might be that psychological distress is an indicator of low socioeconomic position and that the association between psychological distress and CHD could be explained through an association with socioeconomic position. This seems unlikely as GHQ scores do not', ' show a strong association with socioeconomic position measured by employment grade17 and although the confounding might relate to another indicator of social position, employment grade is a precise indicator of income and status in the Civil Service. Additionally, adjustment for employment grade had little effect on the magnitude of the association between CHD and psychological distress. \r\nIn order to take this work further it is necessary to understand what the GHQ is measuring that increases the risk of CHD. It is possible that the GHQ is identifying fatigue and malaise indicating subclinical cardiac illness, which might be an antecedent of overt CHD. On the contrary, the 30-item GHQ was originally derived from the 60-item GHQ in order to eliminate contamination by physical illness. Also the GHQ was developed to screen for psychiatric disorder and scores on the GHQ are correlated with clinical psychiatric disorder and depression.17,23,24 It might be that although the GHQ is not measuring subclinical physical illness it is identifying psychological distress that has arisen as a consequence of subclinical physical illness although this seems unlikely in the relatively young population at baseline in whom those with existing CHD were excluded from these analyses and in whom younger men were more at risk of CHD related to psychological distress than older men. \r\nIf it is accepted that a psychological factor rather than physical illness-related factor is the key element of increased risk, it is still not clear from our analyses whether it might be depressive symptoms or depressive illness that are responsible for increased CHD risk. A recent study suggests that experience of clinical depressive illness is associated with increased CHD risk25 and this seems plausible as major depressive illnesses are associated with raised cortisol levels26 and physical symptoms, and might be expected to be associated with metabolic disturbance increasing coronary risk. Nevertheless, most studies have found that less severe depression, namely depressive symptoms, is predictive of CHD. The GHQ screens for both depressive illness and lesser levels of both depression and anxiety. It may be that persistence of depressive symptoms over long periods of time is more important in the pathogenesis of CHD than shorter episodes of severe depressive illness. Anda2 has suggested that both severity of depression, and chronicity may be important in determining CHD risk. If psychological distress increases CHD risk through long-term pathophysiological processes such as atherosclerosis then it would seem likely that distress may be a marker for a persistent trait such as hopelessness7 or pessimism27 which have been linked to increased mortality risk. A shorter term risk associated with psychological', "" distress would be more in keeping with underlying processes such as increased susceptibility to arrhythmia's or influences on thrombogenesis or inflammation. \r\nHealth-related behaviours, particularly smoking,28 alcohol use, high fat diet and lack of exercise have been associated both with psychological distress and CHD. The plausible hypothesis that the effects of psychological distress are mediated though health behaviours is not supported by our results. Similarly, in another longitudinal study depression predicted CHD but was not associated with physical activity or smoking.25 \r\nSocial isolation, measured by social network analysis predicts CHD morbidity and mortality in many studies.29 Low social support has also been related to decreased survival post-myocardial infarction.30,31 Depression and social relations have been found to have independent effects on all-cause mortality in a French community study32 suggesting that the risk of depression on mortality risk is not mediated by social isolation. It could be that low social support might precede psychological distress on the pathway to CHD. Although low social support may contribute to the causation of psychological distress and hence to CHD in this cohort, it does not seem to explain the association between psychological distress and CHD. Alternatively, psychological distress could be an antecedent of low social support but other analyses in this cohort do not support this. Although we have reported that low control in the workplace predicts CHD,14 as well as psychiatric morbidity,33 it does not seem to explain the psychological distress-CHD association. Moreover, the effect of low control on CHD risk is independent of GHQ score.34 The results reported in this paper suggest that psychological distress has an independent effect on CHD risk which is not explained by psychosocial risk factors for CHD. \r\nWhy does this association between depression and CHD, also found in other studies, appear to be more consistent in men than women?5 Recent reports from the NHANES I Study found that depressive symptoms predicted CHD incidence in both men and women. However, effects differed for mortality where depressive symptoms predicted CHD mortality in men but not in women.6 Similarly, an increased all-cause mortality risk associated with neurotic depression was confined to men in the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly although increased mortality associated with psychotic depression was found in both men and women.35 \r\nWomen have a higher prevalence of depression in the general population and also a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and new CHD in this study, but a lower prevalence of ECG abnormalities"", '. In women there are increased risks for the self-report outcomes, but not for the ECG abnormalities. It may be that this discrepancy, and the higher rates of self-reported coronary outcomes in women, are the result of a greater tendency to symptom reporting with higher rates of false positive CHD outcomes than in men.36 A further reason why women do not have increased coronary risk associated with depression may be due to pre-menopausal hormonal influences which exert a protective influence against CHD. However, it is paradoxical that during this period of the lifespan women have increased vulnerability to depression relative to men. Alternatively, women may deal more constructively with depression than men, talking about their feelings and seeking help which may neutralize the toxic potential of depression to cause CHD. \r\nOur study is limited by our current reliance on broad questionnaire measures of psychological distress and depression and self-report measures of incident CHD, although ECG abnormalities provide an objective estimate of CHD. We are currently collecting hospital and general practitioner records of CHD events and are measuring depression by interview to address this. The GHQ as a non-specific screening tool for psychological distress could be a marker for early decline in physical functioning, which may be a risk factor for CHD. However, removal of prevalent cases of CHD from these prospective analyses makes this less likely. It is possible that health behaviours such as smoking and alcohol consumption assessed by self-report underestimate consumption and therefore underestimate risk. This may be especially the case for assessment of alcohol intake. Nevertheless, studies find agreement between some self-report and objective indices of health behaviours, for instance cotinine and smoking,37 suggesting that certain of our self-report measures may be accurate indicators of behaviour. \r\nAlthough the Whitehall II cohort is an office-based occupational cohort there seems no reason why these results should not generalize to the population at large. Altogether, the results of this study support the existing evidence that psychological distress is a risk factor for CHD, in men, if not in women. Further research is needed to identify which aspects of psychological distress are toxic to the heart. \r\n \r\nAcknowledgments\r\nWe thank all participating civil service departments and their welfare, personnel and establishment officers; the Occupational Health and Safety Agency; the Council of Civil Service Unions; all participating civil servants in the Whitehall II study; and all members of the Whitehall II study team.

Health-related behaviours, particularly smoking,28 alcohol use, high fat diet and lack of exercise have been associated both with psychological distress and CHD. The plausible hypothesis that the effects of psychological distress are mediated though health behaviours is not supported by our results. Similarly, in another longitudinal study depression predicted CHD but was not associated with physical activity or smoking.25 
Social isolation, measured by social network analysis predicts CHD morbidity and mortality in many studies.29 Low social support has also been related to decreased survival post-myocardial infarction.30,31 Depression and social relations have been found to have independent effects on all-cause mortality in a French community study32 suggesting that the risk of depression on mortality risk is not mediated by social isolation. It could be that low social support might precede psychological distress on the pathway to CHD. Although low social support may contribute to the causation of psychological distress and hence to CHD in this cohort, it does not seem to explain the association between psychological distress and CHD. Alternatively, psychological distress could be an antecedent of low social support but other analyses in this cohort do not support this. Although we have reported that low control in the workplace predicts CHD,14 as well as psychiatric morbidity,33 it does not seem to explain the psychological distress-CHD association. Moreover, the effect of low control on CHD risk is independent of GHQ score.34 The results reported in this paper suggest that psychological distress has an independent effect on CHD risk which is not explained by psychosocial risk factors for CHD.

Elucidation of the mechanisms of these associations has implications for prevention. This study aims to confirm the association between psychological distress and CHD and examine if it could be explained by other factors such as health behaviours, social isolation and low control at work. \r\nMethods A prospective occupational cohort study of London-based civil service employees (Whitehall II Study) with baseline data collected from 1985\x961988 with a 5-year follow-up. The participants were male and female middle-aged civil servants working in 20 Government Departments; 73% of eligible employees attended baseline screening. Psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at baseline was used to predict incidence of self-reported CHD and possible and probable electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during follow-up. \r\nResults In men, baseline psychological distress was associated with an increased incidence of overall self-reported CHD (odds ratios [OR] = 1.83, 95% CI : 1.5\x962.3) and ECG abnormalities (OR = 1.51, 95% CI : 1', '.1\x962.1), after adjustment for age, employment grade and length of follow-up. In women, baseline psychological distress was also associated with an increased incidence of CHD (OR = 1.60, 95% CI : 1.2\x962.1), but not with ECG abnormalities. Adjustment for health behaviours, marital status, social networks and work characteristics reduced the risks for incident CHD by 12% in men and by 10% in women; for ECG abnormalities these adjustments increased the risk in men by 16% and had little effect in women. \r\nConclusions The experience of psychological distress confers increased risk of CHD in men that is not explained by health behaviours, social isolation or work characteristics. The increased risk of CHD associated with psychological distress is not consistently demonstrated in women. \r\n        \r\n\t        \r\n        \t\r\n        \r\n        \r\nKeywords Depression, anxiety disorders, coronary disease, epidemiology\r\nAccepted  9 August 2001\r\nPsychological distress, particularly depression, is being increasingly recognized as a risk factor for incident coronary heart disease (CHD).1\x967 Depression is also associated with increased mortality risk following myocardial infarction.8,9 Its emergence as a major CHD risk factor has been relatively recent although for some time it has been recognized as a background risk factor,10 among a cluster of other psychosocial factors with a negative connotation, namely hostility, low control at work, negative life events and social isolation.11 There has been little work exploring how these psychosocial factors might relate to the association between psychological distress and CHD risk. \r\nThere are several potential pathways for the effect of psychological distress on CHD. First, psychological distress may be indirectly associated with CHD through associations with the adoption of unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, eating fatty foods or drinking alcohol excessively, or lack of exercise,12 which in themselves increase the risk of CHD. Second, social isolation may be a behavioural consequence of psychological distress, and an intervening factor between psychological distress and CHD.13 Third, psychological distress may be an outcome of exposure to situations of low perceived control both at work and home, associated with lower socioeconomic status. Thus, if low control at work predisposes to CHD,14 psychological distress may', ' either be an intervening factor on the pathway to CHD or an index of low control or low socioeconomic position related directly to CHD risk. Fourth, psychological distress may have a direct effect on CHD independent of these other behavioural and psychosocial factors, mediated either by neurohumoral activation related to catecholamine secretion or hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis activation and secondary metabolic disturbance. These negative mood states and environmental conditions might all act through a single pathway or these factors might have independent effects on CHD risk. \r\nThis paper uses data from a prospective occupational cohort study, the Whitehall II Study, of middle-aged civil servants to test whether the increased CHD risk associated with psychological distress can be explained by health-related behaviours and psychosocial factors: social isolation and low control at work. Our prior hypothesis was that psychological distress, independently of other negatively-connoted risk factors, would be associated prospectively with increased CHD risk. Psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at Phase 1 (1985\x961988), was used to predict the incidence of CHD over a 5-year period. \r\nMethod\r\nSample\r\nThe Whitehall II Study was set up in 1985 to investigate the causes of the social gradient in morbidity and mortality and included work characteristics and social networks as potential explanations of this gradient. All male and female civil servants, aged between 35 and 55 years in 20 London-based civil service departments were invited to a screening examination, including measurement of blood pressure, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood sample (Phase 1: 1985\x961988). The overall response rate was 73% (74% for men and 71% for women). The true response rates are likely to be higher as around 4% of those on the list of employees moved before the study and thus were ineligible for inclusion. Altogether 10 308 civil servants were examined at baseline\x976895 men (67%) and 3413 women (33%). A postal questionnaire was carried out in 1989 (Phase 2) and the participants had a further screening examination (Phase 3: 1991\x961993). The length of follow-up between Phase 1 and Phase 3 was 5.3 years on average (range 3.7\x967.6). Data on psychosocial factors, health behaviours and medical history were collected by self-report questionnaire at all three phases. Details of the screening examination are reported elsewhere.15 \r\nOf the 10 308', "" participants at baseline, 10 189 had data on psychological distress at baseline. Of these, 582 men and 313 women had self-reported CHD at baseline and were excluded. Of the 9294 participants, a further 139 were excluded because of missing CHD data at Phase 1. Participants were only included if they had complete CHD data at Phase 2 and Phase 3. Thus 2383 participants (1516 men and 867 women) did not complete questionnaires for either Phase 2 or 3 and 199 had uninterpretable data and were also excluded. The remaining 6573 participants (4538 men, 2035 women) were free of CHD at baseline and had incident self-reported CHD status available at Phase 2 or Phase 3. Similarly, 414 men and 239 women had an abnormal ECG data at baseline and were excluded. There were 7503 participants (5238 men and 2265 women) with baseline psychological distress measures who had a normal ECG reading at baseline and on whom incident ECG data were available; the number of participants available with complete data on covariates was 6269 (4374 men, 1895 women) for incident CHD analyses and 7081 (5040 men, 2041 women) for the incident ECG analyses. \r\nEmployment grade\r\nThe Civil Service identifies 12 non-industrial grades on the basis of salary. There is a steep increment in salaries from an annual salary in 1987 of between £3061\x96£5841 in the clerical and office support grades to between £18 020\x96£62 100 the unified grades 1\x966. Besides the steep increment in salaries there were also marked differences in socioeconomic indicators (education, housing tenure, car ownership and father's occupation) by grade of employment.15 \r\nPsychological distress\r\nPsychological distress was measured at each of the three phases by the 30-item GHQ16 which was validated against the Clinical Interview in a sub-sample.17 A threshold of 4/5 on the GHQ was chosen on the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis. At this threshold the sensitivity of the GHQ was 73% and specificity was 78% against the Clinical Interview Schedule. The GHQ is a well-established screening questionnaire for non-psychotic psychological distress, largely depression, suitable for use in general population studies. All those scoring 0\x964 on the GHQ at Phase 1 were considered \x91non-cases' and those scoring 5+ were considered \x91cases'. \r\nCoronary heart"", "" disease and risk factors\r\nThree self-reported indicators of CHD were combined into a single measure of self-reported incident CHD: angina pectoris, severe pain across the chest that lasted half an hour or more from the London School of Hygiene Chest Pain Questionnaire,18 and doctor-diagnosed ischaemia (i.e. a participant's report that a doctor had diagnosed or suspected a heart attack or angina pectoris). To be included as a new case, a participant had to have been free of disease at Phase 1, but to respond positively to one or more of the categories at Phase 2 or Phase 3. A separate measure of ECG abnormalities (i.e. incident ECG abnormalities) at Phase 3 was used as an objective indicator of new CHD. Incident ECG abnormalities included the presence of Q waves with Minnesota codes 1\x961 to 1\x962 (probable ischaemia); any Q wave with codes 1\x961 to 1\x963, S-T or T waves (codes 4\x961 to 4\x964 or 5\x961 to 5\x963) or left bundle branch block (code 7\x961\x961) (possible ischaemia). For each of these outcomes, subjects who were positive at Phase 1 were excluded from analyses. \r\nCoronary risk factors\r\nCoronary risk factors and health-related behaviours were measured in standard ways: smoking status (never, former, current, pipe or cigars only [men only]), body-mass index (kg/m2), and physical activity (1 h vigorous activity per week, <1 h vigorous activity but 1 h moderate activity per week, <1 h vigorous or moderate activity per week). Alcohol intake was measured in units per week and subdivided into categories: none, 1\x9614, 15\x9621, 22+ units, with the highest two categories being combined in women. A healthy diet consisted of wholemeal, granary or wheatmeal bread, skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, and fresh fruits or vegetables at least once daily. An unhealthy diet consisted of other types of bread and milk and less frequent consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables. Eating habits were coded from 0 (unhealthy diet) to 3 (healthy diet). \r\nPsychosocial work characteristics\r\nJob control and psychological job demands based on two of the dimensions in Karasek's Job Content Instrument19 were measured by a self-"", ""completion questionnaire at Phase 1. Fifteen items deal with decision authority and skill discretion and these were combined into an index of decision latitude. \r\nSocial networks\r\nThe social network measures were summarized by a scale that measured the network beyond the household; this includes both frequency of contact and number of contacts with friends and relatives and participation in social groups.20 \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nThe longitudinal relations between psychological distress and subsequent CHD incidence were examined using logistic regression. This allowed the effects of psychological distress (GHQ caseness) to be expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their 95% CI relative to non-cases. In all analyses we controlled for the confounding effects of age and employment grade and also included a term for each individual's length of follow-up between Phase 1 and Phase 3. In order to assess the confounding effects of other factors, we selected the subset of subjects without any missing values and fitted further models just on these subjects. The magnitude of the confounding effects was assessed by calculating the proportion of the excess risk (OR minus 1.0) explained when fitting these terms in the model. The associations of GHQ caseness and the other factors on CHD incidence among this subset of subjects were compared, where possible, with the associations among the subjects who had been excluded because of missing values. These two datasets showed similar associations for most of the factors. \r\nResults\r\nA quarter of men and nearly a third of women scored above the threshold on the GHQ at baseline and were considered possible cases of psychiatric disorder manifesting significant psychological distress (Table 1). These percentages only differed minimally when analyses were restricted to those with incident data. Women reported more incident CHD events at follow-up than men although ECG abnormalities were more common in men than women (Table 1). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 1  Percentages (number of occurrences/number of subjects) of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) caseness at baseline, self-reported incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and possible or probable incident electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities\r\n\xa0\r\nPsychological distress at Phase 1 was associated with increased risk of new reports of CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 in both men and women, adjusting for age, employment grade and length of follow-up (Table 2). General Health Questionnaire caseness at baseline increased the odds of CHD by 83"", '% in men and 60% in women (Table 2). In men, GHQ caseness was also associated with the development of new possible and probable ECG abnormalities at Phase 3 (Table 2). This was not found in women, where, if anything, psychological distress at Phase 1 was associated with lower risk of ECG abnormalities at Phase 3. Younger men, less than 45 years, had a higher risk of new possible and probable ECG abnormalities than older men (men <45, OR = 2.03, 95% CI : 1.2\x963.3; men 45 OR = 1.20, 95% CI : 0.8\x961.9). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 2  Odds ratioa (95% CI) for self-reported incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and possible or probable incident electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities by General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nCovariate factors were chosen as either confounding or mediating factors in the association between psychological distress and CHD on the basis of a prior association with CHD or depression in the research literature. Age-adjusted associations between GHQ caseness and the covariate factors are reported in Table 3. In men, divorce, current smoking status, moderate or little physical activity, low levels of social contacts, low decision latitude and high job demands were all significantly associated with GHQ caseness (Table 3). In women, divorce, high alcohol intake, low social contacts, and high job demands were all significantly associated with GHQ caseness. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 3  Age-adjusted associations (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with General Health Questionnaire caseness\r\n\xa0\r\nAge-adjusted associations between covariates at baseline and self-reported incident CHD at follow-up are reported in Table 4. In men, current smoking, lack of physical activity, higher body mass index, low social networks and low control at work were associated significantly (P < 0.05) with increased coronary risk. In women, widowhood, higher body mass index, medium and low decision latitude and high job demands were associated with increased coronary risk. In men, moderate alcohol intake and, in women, single status, were associated with', ' reduced coronary risk. In relation to incident possible/probable ECG abnormalities, current smoking and higher body mass index were related significantly to increased risk in men but not women where there were no clear associations (Table 5). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 4  Age-adjusted associations (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with self-reported incident coronary heart disease\r\n\xa0\r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 5  Association (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with possible/probable electrocardiographic abnormalities\r\n\xa0\r\nCould these associations between psychological distress and incidence of CHD be explained by existing risk factors for CHD, namely health-related behaviours, social isolation or work characteristics? The risk of new reports of CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 by GHQ caseness at Phase 1 is changed minimally after adjusting for health behaviours in men and women (Table 6). Adjustment for marital status, social networks and work characteristics made only about a 5% change in men but reduced the excess risk by about a quarter in women. Full adjustment for health behaviours, marital status, social networks and work characteristics simultaneously, in addition to age, employment grade and length of employment reduces the excess risk of new reports of CHD by about 10% in men and by just under a quarter in women. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 6  Odds ratiosa (95% CI) for self-reported incident CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 associated with General Health Questionnaire caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nIn men, considering an objective index of CHD, possible and probable ECG abnormalities, adjustment for health behaviours minimally diminished the risk associated with psychological distress of developing ECG abnormalities by Phase 3 (Table 7). Adjustment for marital status, social networks and work characteristics simultaneously increased the risk, with the OR for ECG abnormalities being 1.54 (P = 0.016). In women there was no statistically significant increased risk of ECG abnormalities either before or after adjustment for the risk factors. In general, there is a clear increased risk of CHD associated with psychological distress in men which is not explained by other known psychosocial risk factors for CHD. There was no', ' change in the pattern of results when these analyses were repeated on a dataset with no missing observations for both self-reported CHD and ECG abnormalities. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 7  Odds ratiosa (95% CI) for possible or probable incident electrocardiographic abnormalities at Phase 3 associated with General Health Questionnaire caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nDiscussion\r\nPsychological distress at baseline is predictive of self-reported incident CHD and possible and probable ECG abnormalities in men. The associations are less robust in women and are absent for ECG abnormalities. Health-related behaviours, social networks and control at work, despite associations with psychological distress and some associations with CHD, explain only a small part of the association between psychological distress and CHD. \r\nIt is possible that associations between psychological distress and self-reported outcomes like angina pectoris and severe pain across the chest are confounded by negative affectivity, so-called plaintive set, influencing questionnaire response style21 in which there is a tendency to report negatively on both risk factors and outcomes. This might explain why the association between psychological distress and self-reported CHD is stronger than the association between psychological distress and ECG abnormalities. Nevertheless, the GHQ is a measure of relatively transient psychological distress in most cases and is not a trait measure of neuroticism that might contribute to a negative response style which, for the purpose of this argument, would have had to remain stable over a 5-year follow up period. It is harder to argue that the association between psychological distress and a patho-physiological indicator of CHD, i.e. possible and probable ECG abnormalities, is all due to negative affectivity. Although negative affectivity might influence psychological distress it cannot influence the measurement of ECG abnormalities in a cohort study. At baseline there was no association between high GHQ scores and ECG abnormalities,22 although angina pectoris was associated with higher GHQ scores. This could be due to some selection out of the baseline sample of people with both psychological distress and CHD from among eligible participants, but does not support psychological distress as a consequence of ECG abnormalities in the absence of accompanying symptoms. \r\nAnother possibility might be that psychological distress is an indicator of low socioeconomic position and that the association between psychological distress and CHD could be explained through an association with socioeconomic position. This seems unlikely as GHQ scores do not', ' show a strong association with socioeconomic position measured by employment grade17 and although the confounding might relate to another indicator of social position, employment grade is a precise indicator of income and status in the Civil Service. Additionally, adjustment for employment grade had little effect on the magnitude of the association between CHD and psychological distress. \r\nIn order to take this work further it is necessary to understand what the GHQ is measuring that increases the risk of CHD. It is possible that the GHQ is identifying fatigue and malaise indicating subclinical cardiac illness, which might be an antecedent of overt CHD. On the contrary, the 30-item GHQ was originally derived from the 60-item GHQ in order to eliminate contamination by physical illness. Also the GHQ was developed to screen for psychiatric disorder and scores on the GHQ are correlated with clinical psychiatric disorder and depression.17,23,24 It might be that although the GHQ is not measuring subclinical physical illness it is identifying psychological distress that has arisen as a consequence of subclinical physical illness although this seems unlikely in the relatively young population at baseline in whom those with existing CHD were excluded from these analyses and in whom younger men were more at risk of CHD related to psychological distress than older men. \r\nIf it is accepted that a psychological factor rather than physical illness-related factor is the key element of increased risk, it is still not clear from our analyses whether it might be depressive symptoms or depressive illness that are responsible for increased CHD risk. A recent study suggests that experience of clinical depressive illness is associated with increased CHD risk25 and this seems plausible as major depressive illnesses are associated with raised cortisol levels26 and physical symptoms, and might be expected to be associated with metabolic disturbance increasing coronary risk. Nevertheless, most studies have found that less severe depression, namely depressive symptoms, is predictive of CHD. The GHQ screens for both depressive illness and lesser levels of both depression and anxiety. It may be that persistence of depressive symptoms over long periods of time is more important in the pathogenesis of CHD than shorter episodes of severe depressive illness. Anda2 has suggested that both severity of depression, and chronicity may be important in determining CHD risk. If psychological distress increases CHD risk through long-term pathophysiological processes such as atherosclerosis then it would seem likely that distress may be a marker for a persistent trait such as hopelessness7 or pessimism27 which have been linked to increased mortality risk. A shorter term risk associated with psychological', "" distress would be more in keeping with underlying processes such as increased susceptibility to arrhythmia's or influences on thrombogenesis or inflammation. \r\nHealth-related behaviours, particularly smoking,28 alcohol use, high fat diet and lack of exercise have been associated both with psychological distress and CHD. The plausible hypothesis that the effects of psychological distress are mediated though health behaviours is not supported by our results. Similarly, in another longitudinal study depression predicted CHD but was not associated with physical activity or smoking.25 \r\nSocial isolation, measured by social network analysis predicts CHD morbidity and mortality in many studies.29 Low social support has also been related to decreased survival post-myocardial infarction.30,31 Depression and social relations have been found to have independent effects on all-cause mortality in a French community study32 suggesting that the risk of depression on mortality risk is not mediated by social isolation. It could be that low social support might precede psychological distress on the pathway to CHD. Although low social support may contribute to the causation of psychological distress and hence to CHD in this cohort, it does not seem to explain the association between psychological distress and CHD. Alternatively, psychological distress could be an antecedent of low social support but other analyses in this cohort do not support this. Although we have reported that low control in the workplace predicts CHD,14 as well as psychiatric morbidity,33 it does not seem to explain the psychological distress-CHD association. Moreover, the effect of low control on CHD risk is independent of GHQ score.34 The results reported in this paper suggest that psychological distress has an independent effect on CHD risk which is not explained by psychosocial risk factors for CHD. \r\nWhy does this association between depression and CHD, also found in other studies, appear to be more consistent in men than women?5 Recent reports from the NHANES I Study found that depressive symptoms predicted CHD incidence in both men and women. However, effects differed for mortality where depressive symptoms predicted CHD mortality in men but not in women.6 Similarly, an increased all-cause mortality risk associated with neurotic depression was confined to men in the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly although increased mortality associated with psychotic depression was found in both men and women.35 \r\nWomen have a higher prevalence of depression in the general population and also a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and new CHD in this study, but a lower prevalence of ECG abnormalities"", '. In women there are increased risks for the self-report outcomes, but not for the ECG abnormalities. It may be that this discrepancy, and the higher rates of self-reported coronary outcomes in women, are the result of a greater tendency to symptom reporting with higher rates of false positive CHD outcomes than in men.36 A further reason why women do not have increased coronary risk associated with depression may be due to pre-menopausal hormonal influences which exert a protective influence against CHD. However, it is paradoxical that during this period of the lifespan women have increased vulnerability to depression relative to men. Alternatively, women may deal more constructively with depression than men, talking about their feelings and seeking help which may neutralize the toxic potential of depression to cause CHD. \r\nOur study is limited by our current reliance on broad questionnaire measures of psychological distress and depression and self-report measures of incident CHD, although ECG abnormalities provide an objective estimate of CHD. We are currently collecting hospital and general practitioner records of CHD events and are measuring depression by interview to address this. The GHQ as a non-specific screening tool for psychological distress could be a marker for early decline in physical functioning, which may be a risk factor for CHD. However, removal of prevalent cases of CHD from these prospective analyses makes this less likely. It is possible that health behaviours such as smoking and alcohol consumption assessed by self-report underestimate consumption and therefore underestimate risk. This may be especially the case for assessment of alcohol intake. Nevertheless, studies find agreement between some self-report and objective indices of health behaviours, for instance cotinine and smoking,37 suggesting that certain of our self-report measures may be accurate indicators of behaviour. \r\nAlthough the Whitehall II cohort is an office-based occupational cohort there seems no reason why these results should not generalize to the population at large. Altogether, the results of this study support the existing evidence that psychological distress is a risk factor for CHD, in men, if not in women. Further research is needed to identify which aspects of psychological distress are toxic to the heart. \r\n \r\nAcknowledgments\r\nWe thank all participating civil service departments and their welfare, personnel and establishment officers; the Occupational Health and Safety Agency; the Council of Civil Service Unions; all participating civil servants in the Whitehall II study; and all members of the Whitehall II study team.

Elucidation of the mechanisms of these associations has implications for prevention. This study aims to confirm the association between psychological distress and CHD and examine if it could be explained by other factors such as health behaviours, social isolation and low control at work. \r\nMethods A prospective occupational cohort study of London-based civil service employees (Whitehall II Study) with baseline data collected from 1985\x961988 with a 5-year follow-up. The participants were male and female middle-aged civil servants working in 20 Government Departments; 73% of eligible employees attended baseline screening. Psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at baseline was used to predict incidence of self-reported CHD and possible and probable electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during follow-up. \r\nResults In men, baseline psychological distress was associated with an increased incidence of overall self-reported CHD (odds ratios [OR] = 1.83, 95% CI : 1.5\x962.3) and ECG abnormalities (OR = 1.51, 95% CI : 1', '.1\x962.1), after adjustment for age, employment grade and length of follow-up. In women, baseline psychological distress was also associated with an increased incidence of CHD (OR = 1.60, 95% CI : 1.2\x962.1), but not with ECG abnormalities. Adjustment for health behaviours, marital status, social networks and work characteristics reduced the risks for incident CHD by 12% in men and by 10% in women; for ECG abnormalities these adjustments increased the risk in men by 16% and had little effect in women. \r\nConclusions The experience of psychological distress confers increased risk of CHD in men that is not explained by health behaviours, social isolation or work characteristics. The increased risk of CHD associated with psychological distress is not consistently demonstrated in women. \r\n        \r\n\t        \r\n        \t\r\n        \r\n        \r\nKeywords Depression, anxiety disorders, coronary disease, epidemiology\r\nAccepted  9 August 2001\r\nPsychological distress, particularly depression, is being increasingly recognized as a risk factor for incident coronary heart disease (CHD).1\x967 Depression is also associated with increased mortality risk following myocardial infarction.8,9 Its emergence as a major CHD risk factor has been relatively recent although for some time it has been recognized as a background risk factor,10 among a cluster of other psychosocial factors with a negative connotation, namely hostility, low control at work, negative life events and social isolation.11 There has been little work exploring how these psychosocial factors might relate to the association between psychological distress and CHD risk. \r\nThere are several potential pathways for the effect of psychological distress on CHD. First, psychological distress may be indirectly associated with CHD through associations with the adoption of unhealthy behaviours such as smoking, eating fatty foods or drinking alcohol excessively, or lack of exercise,12 which in themselves increase the risk of CHD. Second, social isolation may be a behavioural consequence of psychological distress, and an intervening factor between psychological distress and CHD.13 Third, psychological distress may be an outcome of exposure to situations of low perceived control both at work and home, associated with lower socioeconomic status. Thus, if low control at work predisposes to CHD,14 psychological distress may', ' either be an intervening factor on the pathway to CHD or an index of low control or low socioeconomic position related directly to CHD risk. Fourth, psychological distress may have a direct effect on CHD independent of these other behavioural and psychosocial factors, mediated either by neurohumoral activation related to catecholamine secretion or hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis activation and secondary metabolic disturbance. These negative mood states and environmental conditions might all act through a single pathway or these factors might have independent effects on CHD risk. \r\nThis paper uses data from a prospective occupational cohort study, the Whitehall II Study, of middle-aged civil servants to test whether the increased CHD risk associated with psychological distress can be explained by health-related behaviours and psychosocial factors: social isolation and low control at work. Our prior hypothesis was that psychological distress, independently of other negatively-connoted risk factors, would be associated prospectively with increased CHD risk. Psychological distress measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) at Phase 1 (1985\x961988), was used to predict the incidence of CHD over a 5-year period. \r\nMethod\r\nSample\r\nThe Whitehall II Study was set up in 1985 to investigate the causes of the social gradient in morbidity and mortality and included work characteristics and social networks as potential explanations of this gradient. All male and female civil servants, aged between 35 and 55 years in 20 London-based civil service departments were invited to a screening examination, including measurement of blood pressure, an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood sample (Phase 1: 1985\x961988). The overall response rate was 73% (74% for men and 71% for women). The true response rates are likely to be higher as around 4% of those on the list of employees moved before the study and thus were ineligible for inclusion. Altogether 10 308 civil servants were examined at baseline\x976895 men (67%) and 3413 women (33%). A postal questionnaire was carried out in 1989 (Phase 2) and the participants had a further screening examination (Phase 3: 1991\x961993). The length of follow-up between Phase 1 and Phase 3 was 5.3 years on average (range 3.7\x967.6). Data on psychosocial factors, health behaviours and medical history were collected by self-report questionnaire at all three phases. Details of the screening examination are reported elsewhere.15 \r\nOf the 10 308', "" participants at baseline, 10 189 had data on psychological distress at baseline. Of these, 582 men and 313 women had self-reported CHD at baseline and were excluded. Of the 9294 participants, a further 139 were excluded because of missing CHD data at Phase 1. Participants were only included if they had complete CHD data at Phase 2 and Phase 3. Thus 2383 participants (1516 men and 867 women) did not complete questionnaires for either Phase 2 or 3 and 199 had uninterpretable data and were also excluded. The remaining 6573 participants (4538 men, 2035 women) were free of CHD at baseline and had incident self-reported CHD status available at Phase 2 or Phase 3. Similarly, 414 men and 239 women had an abnormal ECG data at baseline and were excluded. There were 7503 participants (5238 men and 2265 women) with baseline psychological distress measures who had a normal ECG reading at baseline and on whom incident ECG data were available; the number of participants available with complete data on covariates was 6269 (4374 men, 1895 women) for incident CHD analyses and 7081 (5040 men, 2041 women) for the incident ECG analyses. \r\nEmployment grade\r\nThe Civil Service identifies 12 non-industrial grades on the basis of salary. There is a steep increment in salaries from an annual salary in 1987 of between £3061\x96£5841 in the clerical and office support grades to between £18 020\x96£62 100 the unified grades 1\x966. Besides the steep increment in salaries there were also marked differences in socioeconomic indicators (education, housing tenure, car ownership and father's occupation) by grade of employment.15 \r\nPsychological distress\r\nPsychological distress was measured at each of the three phases by the 30-item GHQ16 which was validated against the Clinical Interview in a sub-sample.17 A threshold of 4/5 on the GHQ was chosen on the basis of receiver operating characteristic analysis. At this threshold the sensitivity of the GHQ was 73% and specificity was 78% against the Clinical Interview Schedule. The GHQ is a well-established screening questionnaire for non-psychotic psychological distress, largely depression, suitable for use in general population studies. All those scoring 0\x964 on the GHQ at Phase 1 were considered \x91non-cases' and those scoring 5+ were considered \x91cases'. \r\nCoronary heart"", "" disease and risk factors\r\nThree self-reported indicators of CHD were combined into a single measure of self-reported incident CHD: angina pectoris, severe pain across the chest that lasted half an hour or more from the London School of Hygiene Chest Pain Questionnaire,18 and doctor-diagnosed ischaemia (i.e. a participant's report that a doctor had diagnosed or suspected a heart attack or angina pectoris). To be included as a new case, a participant had to have been free of disease at Phase 1, but to respond positively to one or more of the categories at Phase 2 or Phase 3. A separate measure of ECG abnormalities (i.e. incident ECG abnormalities) at Phase 3 was used as an objective indicator of new CHD. Incident ECG abnormalities included the presence of Q waves with Minnesota codes 1\x961 to 1\x962 (probable ischaemia); any Q wave with codes 1\x961 to 1\x963, S-T or T waves (codes 4\x961 to 4\x964 or 5\x961 to 5\x963) or left bundle branch block (code 7\x961\x961) (possible ischaemia). For each of these outcomes, subjects who were positive at Phase 1 were excluded from analyses. \r\nCoronary risk factors\r\nCoronary risk factors and health-related behaviours were measured in standard ways: smoking status (never, former, current, pipe or cigars only [men only]), body-mass index (kg/m2), and physical activity (1 h vigorous activity per week, <1 h vigorous activity but 1 h moderate activity per week, <1 h vigorous or moderate activity per week). Alcohol intake was measured in units per week and subdivided into categories: none, 1\x9614, 15\x9621, 22+ units, with the highest two categories being combined in women. A healthy diet consisted of wholemeal, granary or wheatmeal bread, skimmed or semi-skimmed milk, and fresh fruits or vegetables at least once daily. An unhealthy diet consisted of other types of bread and milk and less frequent consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables. Eating habits were coded from 0 (unhealthy diet) to 3 (healthy diet). \r\nPsychosocial work characteristics\r\nJob control and psychological job demands based on two of the dimensions in Karasek's Job Content Instrument19 were measured by a self-"", ""completion questionnaire at Phase 1. Fifteen items deal with decision authority and skill discretion and these were combined into an index of decision latitude. \r\nSocial networks\r\nThe social network measures were summarized by a scale that measured the network beyond the household; this includes both frequency of contact and number of contacts with friends and relatives and participation in social groups.20 \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nThe longitudinal relations between psychological distress and subsequent CHD incidence were examined using logistic regression. This allowed the effects of psychological distress (GHQ caseness) to be expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their 95% CI relative to non-cases. In all analyses we controlled for the confounding effects of age and employment grade and also included a term for each individual's length of follow-up between Phase 1 and Phase 3. In order to assess the confounding effects of other factors, we selected the subset of subjects without any missing values and fitted further models just on these subjects. The magnitude of the confounding effects was assessed by calculating the proportion of the excess risk (OR minus 1.0) explained when fitting these terms in the model. The associations of GHQ caseness and the other factors on CHD incidence among this subset of subjects were compared, where possible, with the associations among the subjects who had been excluded because of missing values. These two datasets showed similar associations for most of the factors. \r\nResults\r\nA quarter of men and nearly a third of women scored above the threshold on the GHQ at baseline and were considered possible cases of psychiatric disorder manifesting significant psychological distress (Table 1). These percentages only differed minimally when analyses were restricted to those with incident data. Women reported more incident CHD events at follow-up than men although ECG abnormalities were more common in men than women (Table 1). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 1  Percentages (number of occurrences/number of subjects) of General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) caseness at baseline, self-reported incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and possible or probable incident electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities\r\n\xa0\r\nPsychological distress at Phase 1 was associated with increased risk of new reports of CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 in both men and women, adjusting for age, employment grade and length of follow-up (Table 2). General Health Questionnaire caseness at baseline increased the odds of CHD by 83"", '% in men and 60% in women (Table 2). In men, GHQ caseness was also associated with the development of new possible and probable ECG abnormalities at Phase 3 (Table 2). This was not found in women, where, if anything, psychological distress at Phase 1 was associated with lower risk of ECG abnormalities at Phase 3. Younger men, less than 45 years, had a higher risk of new possible and probable ECG abnormalities than older men (men <45, OR = 2.03, 95% CI : 1.2\x963.3; men 45 OR = 1.20, 95% CI : 0.8\x961.9). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 2  Odds ratioa (95% CI) for self-reported incident coronary heart disease (CHD) and possible or probable incident electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities by General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nCovariate factors were chosen as either confounding or mediating factors in the association between psychological distress and CHD on the basis of a prior association with CHD or depression in the research literature. Age-adjusted associations between GHQ caseness and the covariate factors are reported in Table 3. In men, divorce, current smoking status, moderate or little physical activity, low levels of social contacts, low decision latitude and high job demands were all significantly associated with GHQ caseness (Table 3). In women, divorce, high alcohol intake, low social contacts, and high job demands were all significantly associated with GHQ caseness. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 3  Age-adjusted associations (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with General Health Questionnaire caseness\r\n\xa0\r\nAge-adjusted associations between covariates at baseline and self-reported incident CHD at follow-up are reported in Table 4. In men, current smoking, lack of physical activity, higher body mass index, low social networks and low control at work were associated significantly (P < 0.05) with increased coronary risk. In women, widowhood, higher body mass index, medium and low decision latitude and high job demands were associated with increased coronary risk. In men, moderate alcohol intake and, in women, single status, were associated with', ' reduced coronary risk. In relation to incident possible/probable ECG abnormalities, current smoking and higher body mass index were related significantly to increased risk in men but not women where there were no clear associations (Table 5). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 4  Age-adjusted associations (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with self-reported incident coronary heart disease\r\n\xa0\r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 5  Association (odds ratios and 95% CI) of covariate factors with possible/probable electrocardiographic abnormalities\r\n\xa0\r\nCould these associations between psychological distress and incidence of CHD be explained by existing risk factors for CHD, namely health-related behaviours, social isolation or work characteristics? The risk of new reports of CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 by GHQ caseness at Phase 1 is changed minimally after adjusting for health behaviours in men and women (Table 6). Adjustment for marital status, social networks and work characteristics made only about a 5% change in men but reduced the excess risk by about a quarter in women. Full adjustment for health behaviours, marital status, social networks and work characteristics simultaneously, in addition to age, employment grade and length of employment reduces the excess risk of new reports of CHD by about 10% in men and by just under a quarter in women. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 6  Odds ratiosa (95% CI) for self-reported incident CHD at Phase 2 or Phase 3 associated with General Health Questionnaire caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nIn men, considering an objective index of CHD, possible and probable ECG abnormalities, adjustment for health behaviours minimally diminished the risk associated with psychological distress of developing ECG abnormalities by Phase 3 (Table 7). Adjustment for marital status, social networks and work characteristics simultaneously increased the risk, with the OR for ECG abnormalities being 1.54 (P = 0.016). In women there was no statistically significant increased risk of ECG abnormalities either before or after adjustment for the risk factors. In general, there is a clear increased risk of CHD associated with psychological distress in men which is not explained by other known psychosocial risk factors for CHD. There was no', ' change in the pattern of results when these analyses were repeated on a dataset with no missing observations for both self-reported CHD and ECG abnormalities. \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTable 7  Odds ratiosa (95% CI) for possible or probable incident electrocardiographic abnormalities at Phase 3 associated with General Health Questionnaire caseness at Phase 1\r\n\xa0\r\nDiscussion\r\nPsychological distress at baseline is predictive of self-reported incident CHD and possible and probable ECG abnormalities in men. The associations are less robust in women and are absent for ECG abnormalities. Health-related behaviours, social networks and control at work, despite associations with psychological distress and some associations with CHD, explain only a small part of the association between psychological distress and CHD. \r\nIt is possible that associations between psychological distress and self-reported outcomes like angina pectoris and severe pain across the chest are confounded by negative affectivity, so-called plaintive set, influencing questionnaire response style21 in which there is a tendency to report negatively on both risk factors and outcomes. This might explain why the association between psychological distress and self-reported CHD is stronger than the association between psychological distress and ECG abnormalities. Nevertheless, the GHQ is a measure of relatively transient psychological distress in most cases and is not a trait measure of neuroticism that might contribute to a negative response style which, for the purpose of this argument, would have had to remain stable over a 5-year follow up period. It is harder to argue that the association between psychological distress and a patho-physiological indicator of CHD, i.e. possible and probable ECG abnormalities, is all due to negative affectivity. Although negative affectivity might influence psychological distress it cannot influence the measurement of ECG abnormalities in a cohort study. At baseline there was no association between high GHQ scores and ECG abnormalities,22 although angina pectoris was associated with higher GHQ scores. This could be due to some selection out of the baseline sample of people with both psychological distress and CHD from among eligible participants, but does not support psychological distress as a consequence of ECG abnormalities in the absence of accompanying symptoms. \r\nAnother possibility might be that psychological distress is an indicator of low socioeconomic position and that the association between psychological distress and CHD could be explained through an association with socioeconomic position. This seems unlikely as GHQ scores do not', ' show a strong association with socioeconomic position measured by employment grade17 and although the confounding might relate to another indicator of social position, employment grade is a precise indicator of income and status in the Civil Service. Additionally, adjustment for employment grade had little effect on the magnitude of the association between CHD and psychological distress. \r\nIn order to take this work further it is necessary to understand what the GHQ is measuring that increases the risk of CHD. It is possible that the GHQ is identifying fatigue and malaise indicating subclinical cardiac illness, which might be an antecedent of overt CHD. On the contrary, the 30-item GHQ was originally derived from the 60-item GHQ in order to eliminate contamination by physical illness. Also the GHQ was developed to screen for psychiatric disorder and scores on the GHQ are correlated with clinical psychiatric disorder and depression.17,23,24 It might be that although the GHQ is not measuring subclinical physical illness it is identifying psychological distress that has arisen as a consequence of subclinical physical illness although this seems unlikely in the relatively young population at baseline in whom those with existing CHD were excluded from these analyses and in whom younger men were more at risk of CHD related to psychological distress than older men. \r\nIf it is accepted that a psychological factor rather than physical illness-related factor is the key element of increased risk, it is still not clear from our analyses whether it might be depressive symptoms or depressive illness that are responsible for increased CHD risk. A recent study suggests that experience of clinical depressive illness is associated with increased CHD risk25 and this seems plausible as major depressive illnesses are associated with raised cortisol levels26 and physical symptoms, and might be expected to be associated with metabolic disturbance increasing coronary risk. Nevertheless, most studies have found that less severe depression, namely depressive symptoms, is predictive of CHD. The GHQ screens for both depressive illness and lesser levels of both depression and anxiety. It may be that persistence of depressive symptoms over long periods of time is more important in the pathogenesis of CHD than shorter episodes of severe depressive illness. Anda2 has suggested that both severity of depression, and chronicity may be important in determining CHD risk. If psychological distress increases CHD risk through long-term pathophysiological processes such as atherosclerosis then it would seem likely that distress may be a marker for a persistent trait such as hopelessness7 or pessimism27 which have been linked to increased mortality risk. A shorter term risk associated with psychological', "" distress would be more in keeping with underlying processes such as increased susceptibility to arrhythmia's or influences on thrombogenesis or inflammation. \r\nHealth-related behaviours, particularly smoking,28 alcohol use, high fat diet and lack of exercise have been associated both with psychological distress and CHD. The plausible hypothesis that the effects of psychological distress are mediated though health behaviours is not supported by our results. Similarly, in another longitudinal study depression predicted CHD but was not associated with physical activity or smoking.25 \r\nSocial isolation, measured by social network analysis predicts CHD morbidity and mortality in many studies.29 Low social support has also been related to decreased survival post-myocardial infarction.30,31 Depression and social relations have been found to have independent effects on all-cause mortality in a French community study32 suggesting that the risk of depression on mortality risk is not mediated by social isolation. It could be that low social support might precede psychological distress on the pathway to CHD. Although low social support may contribute to the causation of psychological distress and hence to CHD in this cohort, it does not seem to explain the association between psychological distress and CHD. Alternatively, psychological distress could be an antecedent of low social support but other analyses in this cohort do not support this. Although we have reported that low control in the workplace predicts CHD,14 as well as psychiatric morbidity,33 it does not seem to explain the psychological distress-CHD association. Moreover, the effect of low control on CHD risk is independent of GHQ score.34 The results reported in this paper suggest that psychological distress has an independent effect on CHD risk which is not explained by psychosocial risk factors for CHD. \r\nWhy does this association between depression and CHD, also found in other studies, appear to be more consistent in men than women?5 Recent reports from the NHANES I Study found that depressive symptoms predicted CHD incidence in both men and women. However, effects differed for mortality where depressive symptoms predicted CHD mortality in men but not in women.6 Similarly, an increased all-cause mortality risk associated with neurotic depression was confined to men in the Amsterdam Study of the Elderly although increased mortality associated with psychotic depression was found in both men and women.35 \r\nWomen have a higher prevalence of depression in the general population and also a higher prevalence of angina pectoris and new CHD in this study, but a lower prevalence of ECG abnormalities"", '. In women there are increased risks for the self-report outcomes, but not for the ECG abnormalities. It may be that this discrepancy, and the higher rates of self-reported coronary outcomes in women, are the result of a greater tendency to symptom reporting with higher rates of false positive CHD outcomes than in men.36 A further reason why women do not have increased coronary risk associated with depression may be due to pre-menopausal hormonal influences which exert a protective influence against CHD. However, it is paradoxical that during this period of the lifespan women have increased vulnerability to depression relative to men. Alternatively, women may deal more constructively with depression than men, talking about their feelings and seeking help which may neutralize the toxic potential of depression to cause CHD. \r\nOur study is limited by our current reliance on broad questionnaire measures of psychological distress and depression and self-report measures of incident CHD, although ECG abnormalities provide an objective estimate of CHD. We are currently collecting hospital and general practitioner records of CHD events and are measuring depression by interview to address this. The GHQ as a non-specific screening tool for psychological distress could be a marker for early decline in physical functioning, which may be a risk factor for CHD. However, removal of prevalent cases of CHD from these prospective analyses makes this less likely. It is possible that health behaviours such as smoking and alcohol consumption assessed by self-report underestimate consumption and therefore underestimate risk. This may be especially the case for assessment of alcohol intake. Nevertheless, studies find agreement between some self-report and objective indices of health behaviours, for instance cotinine and smoking,37 suggesting that certain of our self-report measures may be accurate indicators of behaviour. \r\nAlthough the Whitehall II cohort is an office-based occupational cohort there seems no reason why these results should not generalize to the population at large. Altogether, the results of this study support the existing evidence that psychological distress is a risk factor for CHD, in men, if not in women. Further research is needed to identify which aspects of psychological distress are toxic to the heart. \r\n \r\nAcknowledgments\r\nWe thank all participating civil service departments and their welfare, personnel and establishment officers; the Occupational Health and Safety Agency; the Council of Civil Service Unions; all participating civil servants in the Whitehall II study; and all members of the Whitehall II study team.

We included 73 consecutive patients (62 female) with SLE (four or more ACR criteria) of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis). As control groups we included 130 healthy blood donors and 261 patients with 11 systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD). Disease activity was assessed using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). A venous', ' blood sample was drawn to measure three anti-chromatin antibodies [anti-nucleosome (anti-NCS), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-histones (anti-HST)] by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. \r\nResults. The prevalence of anti-chromatin antibodies in SLE patients and healthy controls was 100 and 3% respectively for anti-NCS, 63 and 5% for anti-dsDNA, and 15 and 3% for anti-HST. Anti-NCS had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97% for SLE diagnosis. When SLE and SAD patients were compared [excluding mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)], the sensitivity of anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies for SLE diagnosis was 93, 71 and 40% respectively and the specificity was 97, 98 and 98%. Anti-chromatin antibodies were not useful in differentiating between SLE and MCTD patients. Anti-NCS antibodies showed the highest correlation with disease activity (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001), especially in patients negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.58, P = 0.001). Anti-NCS antibodies also showed strong association with renal damage (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01). \r\nConclusion. Anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients, especially in patients who are negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies. \r\nKEY WORDS: Anti-nucleosome antibodies, Anti-chromatin antibodies, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Diagnosis, Disease activity.\r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nIntroduction\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against cellular antigens, mainly nuclear antigens, such as anti-histones (anti-HST), anti-single-stranded DNA and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies [1]. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are considered the main diagnostic tool', ' for SLE and a useful marker of disease activity; however, they are found only in 50% of SLE patients and do not always correlate with disease activity [2, 3]. On the other hand, antinuclear antibodies, the most prevalent antibodies, have low specificity for the diagnosis of SLE, because they are found in most systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) and even in healthy individuals [4]. Thus, it is important to look for other autoantibodies that may be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients. \r\nRecently, it was proposed that the nucleosome is the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE, and that anti-nucleosome antibodies (anti-NCS) are associated with organic damage [5\x967]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for the diagnosis of SLE in patients with long disease duration have not been shown to be better than those of anti-dsDNA antibodies [8, 9]. \r\nIn the murine models of lupus, anti-NCS antibodies arise before the development of other anti-chromatin antibodies and they have the highest prevalence from the early stages of life [10]; therefore, we hypothesized that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients of recent onset. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nPatients and methods\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 73 consecutive patients who attended the lupus clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INCMNSZ) between August 1999 and November 2001, with SLE of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria [11]. All patients were evaluated by the same rheumatologist, who assessed disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [12]. A venous blood sample was drawn at the same visit and stored at -70°C to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG)-class anti-chromatin antibodies (anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST). As control groups we included (i) 130 healthy blood donors who tested', "" negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test) (56% females, mean age 34 ± 9 yr) and (ii) 261 prevalent patients with 11 SAD, including 50 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 31 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, 70 with primary vasculitis (Takayasu arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch\x96Schönlein purpura, Behçet disease and microscopic polyangiitis), 50 with primary Sjögren syndrome, 40 with inflammatory myopathy and 20 with systemic sclerosis, according to appropriate classification criteria [13\x9620]. \r\nAnti-chromatin antibodies were determined by immunoenzymatic assay (EIA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations [Orgentec Diagnostika (Germany) (anti-HST and anti-NCS antibodies) and The Binding Site (UK) (anti-dsDNA antibodies)]. Briefly, plates coated with purified human nucleosomes, histones or calf thymus dsDNA were incubated with 100 µl of 1:100 serum dilutions for 30 min at room temperature. Each plate included a calibration curve of five points, a positive control and a negative control. Plates were washed three times with the wash solutions of the kits. A prediluted anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 µl/well) was pipetted into the wells of the microplate and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. After three washes, 100 µl of prediluted substrate was added and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. Colour release was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of prediluted stop solution. Plates were read at 450 nm and a 650 nm reference filter was used. Reproducibility was evaluated using eight positive and negative controls (r = 0.98). Because contamination with Jo-1 in the human nucleosome EIA preparations has been reported (personal communication, Henry Chabre), we tested five anti-Jo-1-positive sera in the three anti-chromatin assays, and all samples were negative to anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA"", "" and anti-HST antibodies (data not shown). These results suggest that the preparation used for coating the plates was not contaminated with Jo-1. \r\nThe cut-off values of anti-chromatin antibodies were set above the mean ± 2 S.D. of a separate control group of 100 healthy individuals (55, 15 and 100 U/ml for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively). Because these values were not useful in differentiating between SAD and SLE patients, we used a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve considering the titres found in 73 SLE patients and 261 patients with rheumatic diseases. Antibody determinations were performed by one of the authors (JC), who was blinded to the clinical information. The study was approved by the Institutional Committee of Biomedical Research at the INCMNSZ. \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nTo determine the diagnostic utility of anti-chromatin antibodies, we used the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± S.D. Pairs of groups were compared using Student's t test for normally distributed continuous variables or the Mann\x96Whitney U test for those without normal distribution. The 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables as needed. For comparisons among three or more groups, an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test or its equivalent non-parametric test was used. As a secondary analysis, the correlation coefficient (Spearman) between anti-chromatin antibodies and disease activity was determined, using a modified SLEDAI in which anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement protein values were excluded to avoid overestimation of the coefficient. Statistical significance was set at P  0.05, two-tailed. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nResults\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe included 73 SLE patients [62 females (85%)] with age 25.6 ± 8.8 yr (range 15\x9661, median 24) and SLE duration 5.5 ± 2.9 months (range 2\x9612, median 5).

Titres of anti-chromatin antibodies in SLE patients were 244 ± 88 U/ml (range 57\x96481 U/ml) for anti-NCS, 335 ± 425 U/ml (range 0\x961540 U/ml) for anti-dsDNA and 48 ± 58 U/ml (range 0\x96237 U/ml) for anti-HST.

Comparing SLE patients and patients with SAD (excluding MCTD), the anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies had a sensitivity of 93, 71 and 40% respectively and specificity of 97, 98 and 98% for SLE diagnosis. When MCTD patients were included in the analysis, the sensitivity was identical, but the specificity decreased to 85, 92 and 96% for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively. \r\nView this', ' table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 3.

The sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for identifying SLE from MCTD patients was 93 and 30% respectively. Therefore, anti-NCS antibodies were not useful for this task. \r\nCorrelation between anti-chromatin antibodies and SLE activity\r\nAll anti-chromatin antibodies correlated with SLE activity (Fig. 1). The correlation coefficient was stronger for anti-NCS antibodies (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) than for anti-HST (r = 0.28, P = 0.01) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.25, P = 0.03). \r\nView larger version (16K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 1.

High titres', ' of anti-NCS antibodies were associated with proteinuria [odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01], haematuria (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.1\x9615.4, P = 0.03), malar rash (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.1\x9619.1, P = 0.03), arthritis (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.8\x9620.6, P = 0.003) and oral ulcers (OR 10.0, 95% CI 2.4\x9642.5, P = 0.001). High titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies were associated with oral ulcers (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.1\x9627.3, P = 0.02) and high titres of anti-HST antibodies were associated with pleuritis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6\x962.7, P = 0.05) (Table 4). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 4.

Considered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained almost 40% of SLE activity (r2 = 0.364, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3).  \r\nView larger version (19K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 3.

Traditional tests used in the diagnosis of SLE, such as antinuclear antibodies, have low specificity because they identify antibodies against nuclear antigens generically [4]. Because the nucleosomes have been considered the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE [5, 6, 21\x9623], we investigated the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in SLE patients with recent onset. \r\nIn this study, anti-NCS antibodies were detected in all SLE patients with recent onset. They showed a high correlation with disease activity, especially among SLE patients who tested negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies, and were strongly associated with renal damage. All the SLE patients we studied had anti-NCS antibodies, whereas anti-dsDNA antibodies were present in only 63%. Previous reports [8, 9], in which SLE patients with longer disease duration (mean 8 yr) were studied, did not show a higher prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies than anti-dsDNA antibodies. We cannot explain the discrepancy in the results between these previous studies and our study. Whether these differences depend on the effect of disease activity or SLE treatment on the antibody titres needs to be determined. \r\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for SLE diagnosis in our study is consistent with findings in murine models of lupus, in which it has been demonstrated that the development of anti-NCS antibodies occurs before other anti-chromatin antibodies [10]. Our results show that the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies is higher than that of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the initial stages. This is similar to what has been reported in murine models of lupus [10]. \r\nConsidered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained close to 40% of SLE activity. Anti-NCS antibodies themselves explained almost 35% of disease activity. These results suggest that anti-NCS antibodies, besides being potentially useful in SLE diagnosis, could be a biological marker of disease activity. \r\nThe presence of anti-NCS antibodies in all SLE patients who were anti-dsDNA-negative and the stronger correlation with disease activity needs to be highlighted, because in this group there is no reliable diagnostic test and no marker of disease activity. \r\nIn our study, only anti-NCS antibodies were associated with renal damage, which suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [24, 25].', ' A positive association of anti-NCS antibodies with renal damage has been demonstrated previously, both in murine models of lupus and in SLE [5, 6, 24, 25]. This association seems to depend on a complex interaction between charges associated with the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes and epitope targets in renal tissue. That is, the histones that constitute part of the nucleosomes have a cationic charge, whereas the glomerular basement membrane has an anionic charge, which permits an interaction between them. \r\nAs also reported by Amoura et al. [8] and Bruns et al. [9], in our study the presence of anti-NCS antibodies was restricted to patients with SLE and MCTD diagnoses. This suggests that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful not only in differentiating individuals with SLE from healthy individuals, but also in differentiating SLE from other forms of SAD. However, the high prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in MCTD restricted their utility in the differential diagnosis of SLE. Nevertheless, we cannot definitively rule out their usefulness in differentiating SLE and MCTD patients at early stages of disease evolution, because the MCTD patients studied did not have disease of recent onset. However, this result is interesting in view of the fact that MCTD and SLE share many clinical and biological characteristics. \r\nWe must acknowledge some limitations of this study. We did not test cross-reaction among anti-chromatin antibodies. However, in two previous reports it was demonstrated that this cross-reaction did not affect the interpretation of the test [8, 9]. Furthermore, we studied a group of SLE patients who were positive only for anti-NCS antibodies and negative for other anti-chromatin antibodies, which is clear evidence of the existence of a group of antibodies that recognize only the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes [26]. \r\nAlthough a strong correlation was found between anti-NCS antibodies and SLEDAI scores, given the cross-sectional nature of the study we were not able to determine whether the titres of anti-NCS antibodies are sensitive to change with disease activity over time. \r\nDespite these limitations, we may conclude that anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of SLE, especially at early stages of the disease, and a useful marker of disease activity, particularly in patients who are negative for anti-', 'dsDNA antibodies. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\xa0\r\nThe authors thank Drs Zahir Amoura, Jean-Charles Piette and Henry Chabre for sharing their expertise in the field of nucleosomes and anti-nucleosome antibodies; and Dr Luis Felipe Flores-Suárez for his collaboration regarding the sera of patients with primary vasculitis.

When SLE and SAD patients were compared [excluding mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)], the sensitivity of anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies for SLE diagnosis was 93, 71 and 40% respectively and the specificity was 97, 98 and 98%. Anti-chromatin antibodies were not useful in differentiating between SLE and MCTD patients. Anti-NCS antibodies showed the highest correlation with disease activity (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001), especially in patients negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.58, P = 0.001). Anti-NCS antibodies also showed strong association with renal damage (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01). \r\nConclusion. Anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients, especially in patients who are negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies. \r\nKEY WORDS: Anti-nucleosome antibodies, Anti-chromatin antibodies, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Diagnosis, Disease activity.\r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nIntroduction\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against cellular antigens, mainly nuclear antigens, such as anti-histones (anti-HST), anti-single-stranded DNA and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies [1]. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are considered the main diagnostic tool', ' for SLE and a useful marker of disease activity; however, they are found only in 50% of SLE patients and do not always correlate with disease activity [2, 3]. On the other hand, antinuclear antibodies, the most prevalent antibodies, have low specificity for the diagnosis of SLE, because they are found in most systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) and even in healthy individuals [4]. Thus, it is important to look for other autoantibodies that may be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients. \r\nRecently, it was proposed that the nucleosome is the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE, and that anti-nucleosome antibodies (anti-NCS) are associated with organic damage [5\x967]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for the diagnosis of SLE in patients with long disease duration have not been shown to be better than those of anti-dsDNA antibodies [8, 9]. \r\nIn the murine models of lupus, anti-NCS antibodies arise before the development of other anti-chromatin antibodies and they have the highest prevalence from the early stages of life [10]; therefore, we hypothesized that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients of recent onset. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nPatients and methods\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 73 consecutive patients who attended the lupus clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INCMNSZ) between August 1999 and November 2001, with SLE of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria [11]. All patients were evaluated by the same rheumatologist, who assessed disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [12]. A venous blood sample was drawn at the same visit and stored at -70°C to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG)-class anti-chromatin antibodies (anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST). As control groups we included (i) 130 healthy blood donors who tested', "" negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test) (56% females, mean age 34 ± 9 yr) and (ii) 261 prevalent patients with 11 SAD, including 50 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 31 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, 70 with primary vasculitis (Takayasu arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch\x96Schönlein purpura, Behçet disease and microscopic polyangiitis), 50 with primary Sjögren syndrome, 40 with inflammatory myopathy and 20 with systemic sclerosis, according to appropriate classification criteria [13\x9620]. \r\nAnti-chromatin antibodies were determined by immunoenzymatic assay (EIA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations [Orgentec Diagnostika (Germany) (anti-HST and anti-NCS antibodies) and The Binding Site (UK) (anti-dsDNA antibodies)]. Briefly, plates coated with purified human nucleosomes, histones or calf thymus dsDNA were incubated with 100 µl of 1:100 serum dilutions for 30 min at room temperature. Each plate included a calibration curve of five points, a positive control and a negative control. Plates were washed three times with the wash solutions of the kits. A prediluted anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 µl/well) was pipetted into the wells of the microplate and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. After three washes, 100 µl of prediluted substrate was added and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. Colour release was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of prediluted stop solution. Plates were read at 450 nm and a 650 nm reference filter was used. Reproducibility was evaluated using eight positive and negative controls (r = 0.98). Because contamination with Jo-1 in the human nucleosome EIA preparations has been reported (personal communication, Henry Chabre), we tested five anti-Jo-1-positive sera in the three anti-chromatin assays, and all samples were negative to anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA"", "" and anti-HST antibodies (data not shown). These results suggest that the preparation used for coating the plates was not contaminated with Jo-1. \r\nThe cut-off values of anti-chromatin antibodies were set above the mean ± 2 S.D. of a separate control group of 100 healthy individuals (55, 15 and 100 U/ml for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively). Because these values were not useful in differentiating between SAD and SLE patients, we used a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve considering the titres found in 73 SLE patients and 261 patients with rheumatic diseases. Antibody determinations were performed by one of the authors (JC), who was blinded to the clinical information. The study was approved by the Institutional Committee of Biomedical Research at the INCMNSZ. \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nTo determine the diagnostic utility of anti-chromatin antibodies, we used the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± S.D. Pairs of groups were compared using Student's t test for normally distributed continuous variables or the Mann\x96Whitney U test for those without normal distribution. The 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables as needed. For comparisons among three or more groups, an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test or its equivalent non-parametric test was used. As a secondary analysis, the correlation coefficient (Spearman) between anti-chromatin antibodies and disease activity was determined, using a modified SLEDAI in which anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement protein values were excluded to avoid overestimation of the coefficient. Statistical significance was set at P  0.05, two-tailed. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nResults\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe included 73 SLE patients [62 females (85%)] with age 25.6 ± 8.8 yr (range 15\x9661, median 24) and SLE duration 5.5 ± 2.9 months (range 2\x9612, median 5).

Comparing SLE patients and patients with SAD (excluding MCTD), the anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies had a sensitivity of 93, 71 and 40% respectively and specificity of 97, 98 and 98% for SLE diagnosis. When MCTD patients were included in the analysis, the sensitivity was identical, but the specificity decreased to 85, 92 and 96% for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively. \r\nView this', ' table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 3.

The sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for identifying SLE from MCTD patients was 93 and 30% respectively. Therefore, anti-NCS antibodies were not useful for this task. \r\nCorrelation between anti-chromatin antibodies and SLE activity\r\nAll anti-chromatin antibodies correlated with SLE activity (Fig. 1). The correlation coefficient was stronger for anti-NCS antibodies (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) than for anti-HST (r = 0.28, P = 0.01) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.25, P = 0.03). \r\nView larger version (16K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 1.

High titres', ' of anti-NCS antibodies were associated with proteinuria [odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01], haematuria (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.1\x9615.4, P = 0.03), malar rash (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.1\x9619.1, P = 0.03), arthritis (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.8\x9620.6, P = 0.003) and oral ulcers (OR 10.0, 95% CI 2.4\x9642.5, P = 0.001). High titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies were associated with oral ulcers (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.1\x9627.3, P = 0.02) and high titres of anti-HST antibodies were associated with pleuritis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6\x962.7, P = 0.05) (Table 4). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 4.

Considered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained almost 40% of SLE activity (r2 = 0.364, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3).  \r\nView larger version (19K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 3.

Traditional tests used in the diagnosis of SLE, such as antinuclear antibodies, have low specificity because they identify antibodies against nuclear antigens generically [4]. Because the nucleosomes have been considered the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE [5, 6, 21\x9623], we investigated the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in SLE patients with recent onset. \r\nIn this study, anti-NCS antibodies were detected in all SLE patients with recent onset. They showed a high correlation with disease activity, especially among SLE patients who tested negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies, and were strongly associated with renal damage. All the SLE patients we studied had anti-NCS antibodies, whereas anti-dsDNA antibodies were present in only 63%. Previous reports [8, 9], in which SLE patients with longer disease duration (mean 8 yr) were studied, did not show a higher prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies than anti-dsDNA antibodies. We cannot explain the discrepancy in the results between these previous studies and our study. Whether these differences depend on the effect of disease activity or SLE treatment on the antibody titres needs to be determined. \r\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for SLE diagnosis in our study is consistent with findings in murine models of lupus, in which it has been demonstrated that the development of anti-NCS antibodies occurs before other anti-chromatin antibodies [10]. Our results show that the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies is higher than that of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the initial stages. This is similar to what has been reported in murine models of lupus [10]. \r\nConsidered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained close to 40% of SLE activity. Anti-NCS antibodies themselves explained almost 35% of disease activity. These results suggest that anti-NCS antibodies, besides being potentially useful in SLE diagnosis, could be a biological marker of disease activity. \r\nThe presence of anti-NCS antibodies in all SLE patients who were anti-dsDNA-negative and the stronger correlation with disease activity needs to be highlighted, because in this group there is no reliable diagnostic test and no marker of disease activity. \r\nIn our study, only anti-NCS antibodies were associated with renal damage, which suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [24, 25].', ' A positive association of anti-NCS antibodies with renal damage has been demonstrated previously, both in murine models of lupus and in SLE [5, 6, 24, 25]. This association seems to depend on a complex interaction between charges associated with the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes and epitope targets in renal tissue. That is, the histones that constitute part of the nucleosomes have a cationic charge, whereas the glomerular basement membrane has an anionic charge, which permits an interaction between them. \r\nAs also reported by Amoura et al. [8] and Bruns et al. [9], in our study the presence of anti-NCS antibodies was restricted to patients with SLE and MCTD diagnoses. This suggests that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful not only in differentiating individuals with SLE from healthy individuals, but also in differentiating SLE from other forms of SAD. However, the high prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in MCTD restricted their utility in the differential diagnosis of SLE. Nevertheless, we cannot definitively rule out their usefulness in differentiating SLE and MCTD patients at early stages of disease evolution, because the MCTD patients studied did not have disease of recent onset. However, this result is interesting in view of the fact that MCTD and SLE share many clinical and biological characteristics. \r\nWe must acknowledge some limitations of this study. We did not test cross-reaction among anti-chromatin antibodies. However, in two previous reports it was demonstrated that this cross-reaction did not affect the interpretation of the test [8, 9]. Furthermore, we studied a group of SLE patients who were positive only for anti-NCS antibodies and negative for other anti-chromatin antibodies, which is clear evidence of the existence of a group of antibodies that recognize only the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes [26]. \r\nAlthough a strong correlation was found between anti-NCS antibodies and SLEDAI scores, given the cross-sectional nature of the study we were not able to determine whether the titres of anti-NCS antibodies are sensitive to change with disease activity over time. \r\nDespite these limitations, we may conclude that anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of SLE, especially at early stages of the disease, and a useful marker of disease activity, particularly in patients who are negative for anti-', 'dsDNA antibodies. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\xa0\r\nThe authors thank Drs Zahir Amoura, Jean-Charles Piette and Henry Chabre for sharing their expertise in the field of nucleosomes and anti-nucleosome antibodies; and Dr Luis Felipe Flores-Suárez for his collaboration regarding the sera of patients with primary vasculitis.

As control groups we included 130 healthy blood donors and 261 patients with 11 systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD). Disease activity was assessed using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). A venous', ' blood sample was drawn to measure three anti-chromatin antibodies [anti-nucleosome (anti-NCS), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-histones (anti-HST)] by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. \r\nResults. The prevalence of anti-chromatin antibodies in SLE patients and healthy controls was 100 and 3% respectively for anti-NCS, 63 and 5% for anti-dsDNA, and 15 and 3% for anti-HST. Anti-NCS had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97% for SLE diagnosis. When SLE and SAD patients were compared [excluding mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)], the sensitivity of anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies for SLE diagnosis was 93, 71 and 40% respectively and the specificity was 97, 98 and 98%. Anti-chromatin antibodies were not useful in differentiating between SLE and MCTD patients. Anti-NCS antibodies showed the highest correlation with disease activity (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001), especially in patients negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.58, P = 0.001). Anti-NCS antibodies also showed strong association with renal damage (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01). \r\nConclusion. Anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients, especially in patients who are negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies. \r\nKEY WORDS: Anti-nucleosome antibodies, Anti-chromatin antibodies, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Diagnosis, Disease activity.\r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nIntroduction\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against cellular antigens, mainly nuclear antigens, such as anti-histones (anti-HST), anti-single-stranded DNA and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies [1]. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are considered the main diagnostic tool', ' for SLE and a useful marker of disease activity; however, they are found only in 50% of SLE patients and do not always correlate with disease activity [2, 3]. On the other hand, antinuclear antibodies, the most prevalent antibodies, have low specificity for the diagnosis of SLE, because they are found in most systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) and even in healthy individuals [4]. Thus, it is important to look for other autoantibodies that may be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients. \r\nRecently, it was proposed that the nucleosome is the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE, and that anti-nucleosome antibodies (anti-NCS) are associated with organic damage [5\x967]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for the diagnosis of SLE in patients with long disease duration have not been shown to be better than those of anti-dsDNA antibodies [8, 9]. \r\nIn the murine models of lupus, anti-NCS antibodies arise before the development of other anti-chromatin antibodies and they have the highest prevalence from the early stages of life [10]; therefore, we hypothesized that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients of recent onset. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nPatients and methods\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 73 consecutive patients who attended the lupus clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INCMNSZ) between August 1999 and November 2001, with SLE of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria [11]. All patients were evaluated by the same rheumatologist, who assessed disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [12]. A venous blood sample was drawn at the same visit and stored at -70°C to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG)-class anti-chromatin antibodies (anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST). As control groups we included (i) 130 healthy blood donors who tested', "" negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test) (56% females, mean age 34 ± 9 yr) and (ii) 261 prevalent patients with 11 SAD, including 50 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 31 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, 70 with primary vasculitis (Takayasu arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch\x96Schönlein purpura, Behçet disease and microscopic polyangiitis), 50 with primary Sjögren syndrome, 40 with inflammatory myopathy and 20 with systemic sclerosis, according to appropriate classification criteria [13\x9620]. \r\nAnti-chromatin antibodies were determined by immunoenzymatic assay (EIA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations [Orgentec Diagnostika (Germany) (anti-HST and anti-NCS antibodies) and The Binding Site (UK) (anti-dsDNA antibodies)]. Briefly, plates coated with purified human nucleosomes, histones or calf thymus dsDNA were incubated with 100 µl of 1:100 serum dilutions for 30 min at room temperature. Each plate included a calibration curve of five points, a positive control and a negative control. Plates were washed three times with the wash solutions of the kits. A prediluted anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 µl/well) was pipetted into the wells of the microplate and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. After three washes, 100 µl of prediluted substrate was added and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. Colour release was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of prediluted stop solution. Plates were read at 450 nm and a 650 nm reference filter was used. Reproducibility was evaluated using eight positive and negative controls (r = 0.98). Because contamination with Jo-1 in the human nucleosome EIA preparations has been reported (personal communication, Henry Chabre), we tested five anti-Jo-1-positive sera in the three anti-chromatin assays, and all samples were negative to anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA"", "" and anti-HST antibodies (data not shown). These results suggest that the preparation used for coating the plates was not contaminated with Jo-1. \r\nThe cut-off values of anti-chromatin antibodies were set above the mean ± 2 S.D. of a separate control group of 100 healthy individuals (55, 15 and 100 U/ml for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively). Because these values were not useful in differentiating between SAD and SLE patients, we used a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve considering the titres found in 73 SLE patients and 261 patients with rheumatic diseases. Antibody determinations were performed by one of the authors (JC), who was blinded to the clinical information. The study was approved by the Institutional Committee of Biomedical Research at the INCMNSZ. \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nTo determine the diagnostic utility of anti-chromatin antibodies, we used the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± S.D. Pairs of groups were compared using Student's t test for normally distributed continuous variables or the Mann\x96Whitney U test for those without normal distribution. The 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables as needed. For comparisons among three or more groups, an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test or its equivalent non-parametric test was used. As a secondary analysis, the correlation coefficient (Spearman) between anti-chromatin antibodies and disease activity was determined, using a modified SLEDAI in which anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement protein values were excluded to avoid overestimation of the coefficient. Statistical significance was set at P  0.05, two-tailed. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nResults\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe included 73 SLE patients [62 females (85%)] with age 25.6 ± 8.8 yr (range 15\x9661, median 24) and SLE duration 5.5 ± 2.9 months (range 2\x9612, median 5).

When MCTD patients were included in the analysis, the sensitivity was identical, but the specificity decreased to 85, 92 and 96% for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively. \r\nView this', ' table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 3.

The sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for identifying SLE from MCTD patients was 93 and 30% respectively. Therefore, anti-NCS antibodies were not useful for this task. \r\nCorrelation between anti-chromatin antibodies and SLE activity\r\nAll anti-chromatin antibodies correlated with SLE activity (Fig. 1). The correlation coefficient was stronger for anti-NCS antibodies (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) than for anti-HST (r = 0.28, P = 0.01) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.25, P = 0.03). \r\nView larger version (16K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 1.

High titres', ' of anti-NCS antibodies were associated with proteinuria [odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01], haematuria (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.1\x9615.4, P = 0.03), malar rash (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.1\x9619.1, P = 0.03), arthritis (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.8\x9620.6, P = 0.003) and oral ulcers (OR 10.0, 95% CI 2.4\x9642.5, P = 0.001). High titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies were associated with oral ulcers (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.1\x9627.3, P = 0.02) and high titres of anti-HST antibodies were associated with pleuritis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6\x962.7, P = 0.05) (Table 4). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 4.

Considered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained almost 40% of SLE activity (r2 = 0.364, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3).  \r\nView larger version (19K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 3.

Traditional tests used in the diagnosis of SLE, such as antinuclear antibodies, have low specificity because they identify antibodies against nuclear antigens generically [4]. Because the nucleosomes have been considered the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE [5, 6, 21\x9623], we investigated the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in SLE patients with recent onset. \r\nIn this study, anti-NCS antibodies were detected in all SLE patients with recent onset. They showed a high correlation with disease activity, especially among SLE patients who tested negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies, and were strongly associated with renal damage. All the SLE patients we studied had anti-NCS antibodies, whereas anti-dsDNA antibodies were present in only 63%. Previous reports [8, 9], in which SLE patients with longer disease duration (mean 8 yr) were studied, did not show a higher prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies than anti-dsDNA antibodies. We cannot explain the discrepancy in the results between these previous studies and our study. Whether these differences depend on the effect of disease activity or SLE treatment on the antibody titres needs to be determined. \r\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for SLE diagnosis in our study is consistent with findings in murine models of lupus, in which it has been demonstrated that the development of anti-NCS antibodies occurs before other anti-chromatin antibodies [10]. Our results show that the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies is higher than that of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the initial stages. This is similar to what has been reported in murine models of lupus [10]. \r\nConsidered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained close to 40% of SLE activity. Anti-NCS antibodies themselves explained almost 35% of disease activity. These results suggest that anti-NCS antibodies, besides being potentially useful in SLE diagnosis, could be a biological marker of disease activity. \r\nThe presence of anti-NCS antibodies in all SLE patients who were anti-dsDNA-negative and the stronger correlation with disease activity needs to be highlighted, because in this group there is no reliable diagnostic test and no marker of disease activity. \r\nIn our study, only anti-NCS antibodies were associated with renal damage, which suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [24, 25].', ' A positive association of anti-NCS antibodies with renal damage has been demonstrated previously, both in murine models of lupus and in SLE [5, 6, 24, 25]. This association seems to depend on a complex interaction between charges associated with the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes and epitope targets in renal tissue. That is, the histones that constitute part of the nucleosomes have a cationic charge, whereas the glomerular basement membrane has an anionic charge, which permits an interaction between them. \r\nAs also reported by Amoura et al. [8] and Bruns et al. [9], in our study the presence of anti-NCS antibodies was restricted to patients with SLE and MCTD diagnoses. This suggests that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful not only in differentiating individuals with SLE from healthy individuals, but also in differentiating SLE from other forms of SAD. However, the high prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in MCTD restricted their utility in the differential diagnosis of SLE. Nevertheless, we cannot definitively rule out their usefulness in differentiating SLE and MCTD patients at early stages of disease evolution, because the MCTD patients studied did not have disease of recent onset. However, this result is interesting in view of the fact that MCTD and SLE share many clinical and biological characteristics. \r\nWe must acknowledge some limitations of this study. We did not test cross-reaction among anti-chromatin antibodies. However, in two previous reports it was demonstrated that this cross-reaction did not affect the interpretation of the test [8, 9]. Furthermore, we studied a group of SLE patients who were positive only for anti-NCS antibodies and negative for other anti-chromatin antibodies, which is clear evidence of the existence of a group of antibodies that recognize only the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes [26]. \r\nAlthough a strong correlation was found between anti-NCS antibodies and SLEDAI scores, given the cross-sectional nature of the study we were not able to determine whether the titres of anti-NCS antibodies are sensitive to change with disease activity over time. \r\nDespite these limitations, we may conclude that anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of SLE, especially at early stages of the disease, and a useful marker of disease activity, particularly in patients who are negative for anti-', 'dsDNA antibodies. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\xa0\r\nThe authors thank Drs Zahir Amoura, Jean-Charles Piette and Henry Chabre for sharing their expertise in the field of nucleosomes and anti-nucleosome antibodies; and Dr Luis Felipe Flores-Suárez for his collaboration regarding the sera of patients with primary vasculitis.

Anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients, especially in patients who are negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies. \r\nKEY WORDS: Anti-nucleosome antibodies, Anti-chromatin antibodies, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Diagnosis, Disease activity.\r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nIntroduction\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against cellular antigens, mainly nuclear antigens, such as anti-histones (anti-HST), anti-single-stranded DNA and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies [1]. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are considered the main diagnostic tool', ' for SLE and a useful marker of disease activity; however, they are found only in 50% of SLE patients and do not always correlate with disease activity [2, 3]. On the other hand, antinuclear antibodies, the most prevalent antibodies, have low specificity for the diagnosis of SLE, because they are found in most systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) and even in healthy individuals [4]. Thus, it is important to look for other autoantibodies that may be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients. \r\nRecently, it was proposed that the nucleosome is the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE, and that anti-nucleosome antibodies (anti-NCS) are associated with organic damage [5\x967]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for the diagnosis of SLE in patients with long disease duration have not been shown to be better than those of anti-dsDNA antibodies [8, 9]. \r\nIn the murine models of lupus, anti-NCS antibodies arise before the development of other anti-chromatin antibodies and they have the highest prevalence from the early stages of life [10]; therefore, we hypothesized that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients of recent onset. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nPatients and methods\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 73 consecutive patients who attended the lupus clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INCMNSZ) between August 1999 and November 2001, with SLE of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria [11]. All patients were evaluated by the same rheumatologist, who assessed disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [12]. A venous blood sample was drawn at the same visit and stored at -70°C to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG)-class anti-chromatin antibodies (anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST). As control groups we included (i) 130 healthy blood donors who tested', "" negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test) (56% females, mean age 34 ± 9 yr) and (ii) 261 prevalent patients with 11 SAD, including 50 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 31 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, 70 with primary vasculitis (Takayasu arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch\x96Schönlein purpura, Behçet disease and microscopic polyangiitis), 50 with primary Sjögren syndrome, 40 with inflammatory myopathy and 20 with systemic sclerosis, according to appropriate classification criteria [13\x9620]. \r\nAnti-chromatin antibodies were determined by immunoenzymatic assay (EIA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations [Orgentec Diagnostika (Germany) (anti-HST and anti-NCS antibodies) and The Binding Site (UK) (anti-dsDNA antibodies)]. Briefly, plates coated with purified human nucleosomes, histones or calf thymus dsDNA were incubated with 100 µl of 1:100 serum dilutions for 30 min at room temperature. Each plate included a calibration curve of five points, a positive control and a negative control. Plates were washed three times with the wash solutions of the kits. A prediluted anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 µl/well) was pipetted into the wells of the microplate and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. After three washes, 100 µl of prediluted substrate was added and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. Colour release was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of prediluted stop solution. Plates were read at 450 nm and a 650 nm reference filter was used. Reproducibility was evaluated using eight positive and negative controls (r = 0.98). Because contamination with Jo-1 in the human nucleosome EIA preparations has been reported (personal communication, Henry Chabre), we tested five anti-Jo-1-positive sera in the three anti-chromatin assays, and all samples were negative to anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA"", "" and anti-HST antibodies (data not shown). These results suggest that the preparation used for coating the plates was not contaminated with Jo-1. \r\nThe cut-off values of anti-chromatin antibodies were set above the mean ± 2 S.D. of a separate control group of 100 healthy individuals (55, 15 and 100 U/ml for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively). Because these values were not useful in differentiating between SAD and SLE patients, we used a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve considering the titres found in 73 SLE patients and 261 patients with rheumatic diseases. Antibody determinations were performed by one of the authors (JC), who was blinded to the clinical information. The study was approved by the Institutional Committee of Biomedical Research at the INCMNSZ. \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nTo determine the diagnostic utility of anti-chromatin antibodies, we used the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± S.D. Pairs of groups were compared using Student's t test for normally distributed continuous variables or the Mann\x96Whitney U test for those without normal distribution. The 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables as needed. For comparisons among three or more groups, an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test or its equivalent non-parametric test was used. As a secondary analysis, the correlation coefficient (Spearman) between anti-chromatin antibodies and disease activity was determined, using a modified SLEDAI in which anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement protein values were excluded to avoid overestimation of the coefficient. Statistical significance was set at P  0.05, two-tailed. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nResults\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe included 73 SLE patients [62 females (85%)] with age 25.6 ± 8.8 yr (range 15\x9661, median 24) and SLE duration 5.5 ± 2.9 months (range 2\x9612, median 5).

Comparing SLE patients and patients with SAD (excluding MCTD), the anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies had a sensitivity of 93, 71 and 40% respectively and specificity of 97, 98 and 98% for SLE diagnosis. When MCTD patients were included in the analysis, the sensitivity was identical, but the specificity decreased to 85, 92 and 96% for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively. \r\nView this', ' table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 3.

The sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for identifying SLE from MCTD patients was 93 and 30% respectively. Therefore, anti-NCS antibodies were not useful for this task. \r\nCorrelation between anti-chromatin antibodies and SLE activity\r\nAll anti-chromatin antibodies correlated with SLE activity (Fig. 1). The correlation coefficient was stronger for anti-NCS antibodies (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) than for anti-HST (r = 0.28, P = 0.01) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.25, P = 0.03). \r\nView larger version (16K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 1.

High titres', ' of anti-NCS antibodies were associated with proteinuria [odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01], haematuria (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.1\x9615.4, P = 0.03), malar rash (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.1\x9619.1, P = 0.03), arthritis (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.8\x9620.6, P = 0.003) and oral ulcers (OR 10.0, 95% CI 2.4\x9642.5, P = 0.001). High titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies were associated with oral ulcers (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.1\x9627.3, P = 0.02) and high titres of anti-HST antibodies were associated with pleuritis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6\x962.7, P = 0.05) (Table 4). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 4.

Considered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained almost 40% of SLE activity (r2 = 0.364, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3).  \r\nView larger version (19K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 3.

Traditional tests used in the diagnosis of SLE, such as antinuclear antibodies, have low specificity because they identify antibodies against nuclear antigens generically [4]. Because the nucleosomes have been considered the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE [5, 6, 21\x9623], we investigated the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in SLE patients with recent onset. \r\nIn this study, anti-NCS antibodies were detected in all SLE patients with recent onset. They showed a high correlation with disease activity, especially among SLE patients who tested negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies, and were strongly associated with renal damage. All the SLE patients we studied had anti-NCS antibodies, whereas anti-dsDNA antibodies were present in only 63%. Previous reports [8, 9], in which SLE patients with longer disease duration (mean 8 yr) were studied, did not show a higher prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies than anti-dsDNA antibodies. We cannot explain the discrepancy in the results between these previous studies and our study. Whether these differences depend on the effect of disease activity or SLE treatment on the antibody titres needs to be determined. \r\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for SLE diagnosis in our study is consistent with findings in murine models of lupus, in which it has been demonstrated that the development of anti-NCS antibodies occurs before other anti-chromatin antibodies [10]. Our results show that the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies is higher than that of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the initial stages. This is similar to what has been reported in murine models of lupus [10]. \r\nConsidered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained close to 40% of SLE activity. Anti-NCS antibodies themselves explained almost 35% of disease activity. These results suggest that anti-NCS antibodies, besides being potentially useful in SLE diagnosis, could be a biological marker of disease activity. \r\nThe presence of anti-NCS antibodies in all SLE patients who were anti-dsDNA-negative and the stronger correlation with disease activity needs to be highlighted, because in this group there is no reliable diagnostic test and no marker of disease activity. \r\nIn our study, only anti-NCS antibodies were associated with renal damage, which suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [24, 25].', ' A positive association of anti-NCS antibodies with renal damage has been demonstrated previously, both in murine models of lupus and in SLE [5, 6, 24, 25]. This association seems to depend on a complex interaction between charges associated with the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes and epitope targets in renal tissue. That is, the histones that constitute part of the nucleosomes have a cationic charge, whereas the glomerular basement membrane has an anionic charge, which permits an interaction between them. \r\nAs also reported by Amoura et al. [8] and Bruns et al. [9], in our study the presence of anti-NCS antibodies was restricted to patients with SLE and MCTD diagnoses. This suggests that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful not only in differentiating individuals with SLE from healthy individuals, but also in differentiating SLE from other forms of SAD. However, the high prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in MCTD restricted their utility in the differential diagnosis of SLE. Nevertheless, we cannot definitively rule out their usefulness in differentiating SLE and MCTD patients at early stages of disease evolution, because the MCTD patients studied did not have disease of recent onset. However, this result is interesting in view of the fact that MCTD and SLE share many clinical and biological characteristics. \r\nWe must acknowledge some limitations of this study. We did not test cross-reaction among anti-chromatin antibodies. However, in two previous reports it was demonstrated that this cross-reaction did not affect the interpretation of the test [8, 9]. Furthermore, we studied a group of SLE patients who were positive only for anti-NCS antibodies and negative for other anti-chromatin antibodies, which is clear evidence of the existence of a group of antibodies that recognize only the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes [26]. \r\nAlthough a strong correlation was found between anti-NCS antibodies and SLEDAI scores, given the cross-sectional nature of the study we were not able to determine whether the titres of anti-NCS antibodies are sensitive to change with disease activity over time. \r\nDespite these limitations, we may conclude that anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of SLE, especially at early stages of the disease, and a useful marker of disease activity, particularly in patients who are negative for anti-', 'dsDNA antibodies. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\xa0\r\nThe authors thank Drs Zahir Amoura, Jean-Charles Piette and Henry Chabre for sharing their expertise in the field of nucleosomes and anti-nucleosome antibodies; and Dr Luis Felipe Flores-Suárez for his collaboration regarding the sera of patients with primary vasculitis.

To compare the utility of anti-chromatin antibodies for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and as markers of disease activity. \r\nMethods. We included 73 consecutive patients (62 female) with SLE (four or more ACR criteria) of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis). As control groups we included 130 healthy blood donors and 261 patients with 11 systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD). Disease activity was assessed using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). A venous', ' blood sample was drawn to measure three anti-chromatin antibodies [anti-nucleosome (anti-NCS), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-histones (anti-HST)] by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. \r\nResults. The prevalence of anti-chromatin antibodies in SLE patients and healthy controls was 100 and 3% respectively for anti-NCS, 63 and 5% for anti-dsDNA, and 15 and 3% for anti-HST. Anti-NCS had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97% for SLE diagnosis. When SLE and SAD patients were compared [excluding mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)], the sensitivity of anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies for SLE diagnosis was 93, 71 and 40% respectively and the specificity was 97, 98 and 98%. Anti-chromatin antibodies were not useful in differentiating between SLE and MCTD patients. Anti-NCS antibodies showed the highest correlation with disease activity (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001), especially in patients negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.58, P = 0.001). Anti-NCS antibodies also showed strong association with renal damage (odds ratio 4.1, 95% confidence interval 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01). \r\nConclusion. Anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients, especially in patients who are negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies. \r\nKEY WORDS: Anti-nucleosome antibodies, Anti-chromatin antibodies, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Diagnosis, Disease activity.\r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nIntroduction\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown aetiology, characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against cellular antigens, mainly nuclear antigens, such as anti-histones (anti-HST), anti-single-stranded DNA and anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies [1]. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are considered the main diagnostic tool', ' for SLE and a useful marker of disease activity; however, they are found only in 50% of SLE patients and do not always correlate with disease activity [2, 3]. On the other hand, antinuclear antibodies, the most prevalent antibodies, have low specificity for the diagnosis of SLE, because they are found in most systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) and even in healthy individuals [4]. Thus, it is important to look for other autoantibodies that may be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients. \r\nRecently, it was proposed that the nucleosome is the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE, and that anti-nucleosome antibodies (anti-NCS) are associated with organic damage [5\x967]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for the diagnosis of SLE in patients with long disease duration have not been shown to be better than those of anti-dsDNA antibodies [8, 9]. \r\nIn the murine models of lupus, anti-NCS antibodies arise before the development of other anti-chromatin antibodies and they have the highest prevalence from the early stages of life [10]; therefore, we hypothesized that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients of recent onset. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nPatients and methods\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 73 consecutive patients who attended the lupus clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INCMNSZ) between August 1999 and November 2001, with SLE of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria [11]. All patients were evaluated by the same rheumatologist, who assessed disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [12]. A venous blood sample was drawn at the same visit and stored at -70°C to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG)-class anti-chromatin antibodies (anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST). As control groups we included (i) 130 healthy blood donors who tested', "" negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test) (56% females, mean age 34 ± 9 yr) and (ii) 261 prevalent patients with 11 SAD, including 50 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 31 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, 70 with primary vasculitis (Takayasu arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch\x96Schönlein purpura, Behçet disease and microscopic polyangiitis), 50 with primary Sjögren syndrome, 40 with inflammatory myopathy and 20 with systemic sclerosis, according to appropriate classification criteria [13\x9620]. \r\nAnti-chromatin antibodies were determined by immunoenzymatic assay (EIA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations [Orgentec Diagnostika (Germany) (anti-HST and anti-NCS antibodies) and The Binding Site (UK) (anti-dsDNA antibodies)]. Briefly, plates coated with purified human nucleosomes, histones or calf thymus dsDNA were incubated with 100 µl of 1:100 serum dilutions for 30 min at room temperature. Each plate included a calibration curve of five points, a positive control and a negative control. Plates were washed three times with the wash solutions of the kits. A prediluted anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 µl/well) was pipetted into the wells of the microplate and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. After three washes, 100 µl of prediluted substrate was added and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. Colour release was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of prediluted stop solution. Plates were read at 450 nm and a 650 nm reference filter was used. Reproducibility was evaluated using eight positive and negative controls (r = 0.98). Because contamination with Jo-1 in the human nucleosome EIA preparations has been reported (personal communication, Henry Chabre), we tested five anti-Jo-1-positive sera in the three anti-chromatin assays, and all samples were negative to anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA"", "" and anti-HST antibodies (data not shown). These results suggest that the preparation used for coating the plates was not contaminated with Jo-1. \r\nThe cut-off values of anti-chromatin antibodies were set above the mean ± 2 S.D. of a separate control group of 100 healthy individuals (55, 15 and 100 U/ml for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively). Because these values were not useful in differentiating between SAD and SLE patients, we used a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve considering the titres found in 73 SLE patients and 261 patients with rheumatic diseases. Antibody determinations were performed by one of the authors (JC), who was blinded to the clinical information. The study was approved by the Institutional Committee of Biomedical Research at the INCMNSZ. \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nTo determine the diagnostic utility of anti-chromatin antibodies, we used the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± S.D. Pairs of groups were compared using Student's t test for normally distributed continuous variables or the Mann\x96Whitney U test for those without normal distribution. The 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables as needed. For comparisons among three or more groups, an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test or its equivalent non-parametric test was used. As a secondary analysis, the correlation coefficient (Spearman) between anti-chromatin antibodies and disease activity was determined, using a modified SLEDAI in which anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement protein values were excluded to avoid overestimation of the coefficient. Statistical significance was set at P  0.05, two-tailed. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nResults\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe included 73 SLE patients [62 females (85%)] with age 25.6 ± 8.8 yr (range 15\x9661, median 24) and SLE duration 5.5 ± 2.9 months (range 2\x9612, median 5).

Therefore, anti-NCS antibodies were not useful for this task. \r\nCorrelation between anti-chromatin antibodies and SLE activity\r\nAll anti-chromatin antibodies correlated with SLE activity (Fig. 1). The correlation coefficient was stronger for anti-NCS antibodies (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) than for anti-HST (r = 0.28, P = 0.01) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.25, P = 0.03). \r\nView larger version (16K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 1.

High titres', ' of anti-NCS antibodies were associated with proteinuria [odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01], haematuria (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.1\x9615.4, P = 0.03), malar rash (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.1\x9619.1, P = 0.03), arthritis (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.8\x9620.6, P = 0.003) and oral ulcers (OR 10.0, 95% CI 2.4\x9642.5, P = 0.001). High titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies were associated with oral ulcers (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.1\x9627.3, P = 0.02) and high titres of anti-HST antibodies were associated with pleuritis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6\x962.7, P = 0.05) (Table 4). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 4.

Considered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained almost 40% of SLE activity (r2 = 0.364, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3).  \r\nView larger version (19K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 3.

Traditional tests used in the diagnosis of SLE, such as antinuclear antibodies, have low specificity because they identify antibodies against nuclear antigens generically [4]. Because the nucleosomes have been considered the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE [5, 6, 21\x9623], we investigated the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in SLE patients with recent onset. \r\nIn this study, anti-NCS antibodies were detected in all SLE patients with recent onset. They showed a high correlation with disease activity, especially among SLE patients who tested negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies, and were strongly associated with renal damage. All the SLE patients we studied had anti-NCS antibodies, whereas anti-dsDNA antibodies were present in only 63%. Previous reports [8, 9], in which SLE patients with longer disease duration (mean 8 yr) were studied, did not show a higher prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies than anti-dsDNA antibodies. We cannot explain the discrepancy in the results between these previous studies and our study. Whether these differences depend on the effect of disease activity or SLE treatment on the antibody titres needs to be determined. \r\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for SLE diagnosis in our study is consistent with findings in murine models of lupus, in which it has been demonstrated that the development of anti-NCS antibodies occurs before other anti-chromatin antibodies [10]. Our results show that the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies is higher than that of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the initial stages. This is similar to what has been reported in murine models of lupus [10]. \r\nConsidered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained close to 40% of SLE activity. Anti-NCS antibodies themselves explained almost 35% of disease activity. These results suggest that anti-NCS antibodies, besides being potentially useful in SLE diagnosis, could be a biological marker of disease activity. \r\nThe presence of anti-NCS antibodies in all SLE patients who were anti-dsDNA-negative and the stronger correlation with disease activity needs to be highlighted, because in this group there is no reliable diagnostic test and no marker of disease activity. \r\nIn our study, only anti-NCS antibodies were associated with renal damage, which suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [24, 25].', ' A positive association of anti-NCS antibodies with renal damage has been demonstrated previously, both in murine models of lupus and in SLE [5, 6, 24, 25]. This association seems to depend on a complex interaction between charges associated with the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes and epitope targets in renal tissue. That is, the histones that constitute part of the nucleosomes have a cationic charge, whereas the glomerular basement membrane has an anionic charge, which permits an interaction between them. \r\nAs also reported by Amoura et al. [8] and Bruns et al. [9], in our study the presence of anti-NCS antibodies was restricted to patients with SLE and MCTD diagnoses. This suggests that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful not only in differentiating individuals with SLE from healthy individuals, but also in differentiating SLE from other forms of SAD. However, the high prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in MCTD restricted their utility in the differential diagnosis of SLE. Nevertheless, we cannot definitively rule out their usefulness in differentiating SLE and MCTD patients at early stages of disease evolution, because the MCTD patients studied did not have disease of recent onset. However, this result is interesting in view of the fact that MCTD and SLE share many clinical and biological characteristics. \r\nWe must acknowledge some limitations of this study. We did not test cross-reaction among anti-chromatin antibodies. However, in two previous reports it was demonstrated that this cross-reaction did not affect the interpretation of the test [8, 9]. Furthermore, we studied a group of SLE patients who were positive only for anti-NCS antibodies and negative for other anti-chromatin antibodies, which is clear evidence of the existence of a group of antibodies that recognize only the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes [26]. \r\nAlthough a strong correlation was found between anti-NCS antibodies and SLEDAI scores, given the cross-sectional nature of the study we were not able to determine whether the titres of anti-NCS antibodies are sensitive to change with disease activity over time. \r\nDespite these limitations, we may conclude that anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of SLE, especially at early stages of the disease, and a useful marker of disease activity, particularly in patients who are negative for anti-', 'dsDNA antibodies. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\xa0\r\nThe authors thank Drs Zahir Amoura, Jean-Charles Piette and Henry Chabre for sharing their expertise in the field of nucleosomes and anti-nucleosome antibodies; and Dr Luis Felipe Flores-Suárez for his collaboration regarding the sera of patients with primary vasculitis.

On the other hand, antinuclear antibodies, the most prevalent antibodies, have low specificity for the diagnosis of SLE, because they are found in most systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) and even in healthy individuals [4]. Thus, it is important to look for other autoantibodies that may be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients. \r\nRecently, it was proposed that the nucleosome is the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE, and that anti-nucleosome antibodies (anti-NCS) are associated with organic damage [5\x967]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for the diagnosis of SLE in patients with long disease duration have not been shown to be better than those of anti-dsDNA antibodies [8, 9]. \r\nIn the murine models of lupus, anti-NCS antibodies arise before the development of other anti-chromatin antibodies and they have the highest prevalence from the early stages of life [10]; therefore, we hypothesized that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients of recent onset. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nPatients and methods\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 73 consecutive patients who attended the lupus clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INCMNSZ) between August 1999 and November 2001, with SLE of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria [11]. All patients were evaluated by the same rheumatologist, who assessed disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [12]. A venous blood sample was drawn at the same visit and stored at -70°C to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG)-class anti-chromatin antibodies (anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST). As control groups we included (i) 130 healthy blood donors who tested', "" negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test) (56% females, mean age 34 ± 9 yr) and (ii) 261 prevalent patients with 11 SAD, including 50 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 31 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, 70 with primary vasculitis (Takayasu arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch\x96Schönlein purpura, Behçet disease and microscopic polyangiitis), 50 with primary Sjögren syndrome, 40 with inflammatory myopathy and 20 with systemic sclerosis, according to appropriate classification criteria [13\x9620]. \r\nAnti-chromatin antibodies were determined by immunoenzymatic assay (EIA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations [Orgentec Diagnostika (Germany) (anti-HST and anti-NCS antibodies) and The Binding Site (UK) (anti-dsDNA antibodies)]. Briefly, plates coated with purified human nucleosomes, histones or calf thymus dsDNA were incubated with 100 µl of 1:100 serum dilutions for 30 min at room temperature. Each plate included a calibration curve of five points, a positive control and a negative control. Plates were washed three times with the wash solutions of the kits. A prediluted anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 µl/well) was pipetted into the wells of the microplate and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. After three washes, 100 µl of prediluted substrate was added and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. Colour release was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of prediluted stop solution. Plates were read at 450 nm and a 650 nm reference filter was used. Reproducibility was evaluated using eight positive and negative controls (r = 0.98). Because contamination with Jo-1 in the human nucleosome EIA preparations has been reported (personal communication, Henry Chabre), we tested five anti-Jo-1-positive sera in the three anti-chromatin assays, and all samples were negative to anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA"", "" and anti-HST antibodies (data not shown). These results suggest that the preparation used for coating the plates was not contaminated with Jo-1. \r\nThe cut-off values of anti-chromatin antibodies were set above the mean ± 2 S.D. of a separate control group of 100 healthy individuals (55, 15 and 100 U/ml for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively). Because these values were not useful in differentiating between SAD and SLE patients, we used a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve considering the titres found in 73 SLE patients and 261 patients with rheumatic diseases. Antibody determinations were performed by one of the authors (JC), who was blinded to the clinical information. The study was approved by the Institutional Committee of Biomedical Research at the INCMNSZ. \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nTo determine the diagnostic utility of anti-chromatin antibodies, we used the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± S.D. Pairs of groups were compared using Student's t test for normally distributed continuous variables or the Mann\x96Whitney U test for those without normal distribution. The 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables as needed. For comparisons among three or more groups, an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test or its equivalent non-parametric test was used. As a secondary analysis, the correlation coefficient (Spearman) between anti-chromatin antibodies and disease activity was determined, using a modified SLEDAI in which anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement protein values were excluded to avoid overestimation of the coefficient. Statistical significance was set at P  0.05, two-tailed. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nResults\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe included 73 SLE patients [62 females (85%)] with age 25.6 ± 8.8 yr (range 15\x9661, median 24) and SLE duration 5.5 ± 2.9 months (range 2\x9612, median 5).

Comparing SLE patients and patients with SAD (excluding MCTD), the anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies had a sensitivity of 93, 71 and 40% respectively and specificity of 97, 98 and 98% for SLE diagnosis. When MCTD patients were included in the analysis, the sensitivity was identical, but the specificity decreased to 85, 92 and 96% for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively. \r\nView this', ' table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 3.

The sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for identifying SLE from MCTD patients was 93 and 30% respectively. Therefore, anti-NCS antibodies were not useful for this task. \r\nCorrelation between anti-chromatin antibodies and SLE activity\r\nAll anti-chromatin antibodies correlated with SLE activity (Fig. 1). The correlation coefficient was stronger for anti-NCS antibodies (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) than for anti-HST (r = 0.28, P = 0.01) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.25, P = 0.03). \r\nView larger version (16K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 1.

High titres', ' of anti-NCS antibodies were associated with proteinuria [odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01], haematuria (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.1\x9615.4, P = 0.03), malar rash (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.1\x9619.1, P = 0.03), arthritis (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.8\x9620.6, P = 0.003) and oral ulcers (OR 10.0, 95% CI 2.4\x9642.5, P = 0.001). High titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies were associated with oral ulcers (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.1\x9627.3, P = 0.02) and high titres of anti-HST antibodies were associated with pleuritis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6\x962.7, P = 0.05) (Table 4). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 4.

Considered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained almost 40% of SLE activity (r2 = 0.364, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3).  \r\nView larger version (19K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 3.

Traditional tests used in the diagnosis of SLE, such as antinuclear antibodies, have low specificity because they identify antibodies against nuclear antigens generically [4]. Because the nucleosomes have been considered the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE [5, 6, 21\x9623], we investigated the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in SLE patients with recent onset. \r\nIn this study, anti-NCS antibodies were detected in all SLE patients with recent onset. They showed a high correlation with disease activity, especially among SLE patients who tested negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies, and were strongly associated with renal damage. All the SLE patients we studied had anti-NCS antibodies, whereas anti-dsDNA antibodies were present in only 63%. Previous reports [8, 9], in which SLE patients with longer disease duration (mean 8 yr) were studied, did not show a higher prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies than anti-dsDNA antibodies. We cannot explain the discrepancy in the results between these previous studies and our study. Whether these differences depend on the effect of disease activity or SLE treatment on the antibody titres needs to be determined. \r\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for SLE diagnosis in our study is consistent with findings in murine models of lupus, in which it has been demonstrated that the development of anti-NCS antibodies occurs before other anti-chromatin antibodies [10]. Our results show that the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies is higher than that of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the initial stages. This is similar to what has been reported in murine models of lupus [10]. \r\nConsidered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained close to 40% of SLE activity. Anti-NCS antibodies themselves explained almost 35% of disease activity. These results suggest that anti-NCS antibodies, besides being potentially useful in SLE diagnosis, could be a biological marker of disease activity. \r\nThe presence of anti-NCS antibodies in all SLE patients who were anti-dsDNA-negative and the stronger correlation with disease activity needs to be highlighted, because in this group there is no reliable diagnostic test and no marker of disease activity. \r\nIn our study, only anti-NCS antibodies were associated with renal damage, which suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [24, 25].', ' A positive association of anti-NCS antibodies with renal damage has been demonstrated previously, both in murine models of lupus and in SLE [5, 6, 24, 25]. This association seems to depend on a complex interaction between charges associated with the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes and epitope targets in renal tissue. That is, the histones that constitute part of the nucleosomes have a cationic charge, whereas the glomerular basement membrane has an anionic charge, which permits an interaction between them. \r\nAs also reported by Amoura et al. [8] and Bruns et al. [9], in our study the presence of anti-NCS antibodies was restricted to patients with SLE and MCTD diagnoses. This suggests that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful not only in differentiating individuals with SLE from healthy individuals, but also in differentiating SLE from other forms of SAD. However, the high prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in MCTD restricted their utility in the differential diagnosis of SLE. Nevertheless, we cannot definitively rule out their usefulness in differentiating SLE and MCTD patients at early stages of disease evolution, because the MCTD patients studied did not have disease of recent onset. However, this result is interesting in view of the fact that MCTD and SLE share many clinical and biological characteristics. \r\nWe must acknowledge some limitations of this study. We did not test cross-reaction among anti-chromatin antibodies. However, in two previous reports it was demonstrated that this cross-reaction did not affect the interpretation of the test [8, 9]. Furthermore, we studied a group of SLE patients who were positive only for anti-NCS antibodies and negative for other anti-chromatin antibodies, which is clear evidence of the existence of a group of antibodies that recognize only the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes [26]. \r\nAlthough a strong correlation was found between anti-NCS antibodies and SLEDAI scores, given the cross-sectional nature of the study we were not able to determine whether the titres of anti-NCS antibodies are sensitive to change with disease activity over time. \r\nDespite these limitations, we may conclude that anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of SLE, especially at early stages of the disease, and a useful marker of disease activity, particularly in patients who are negative for anti-', 'dsDNA antibodies. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\xa0\r\nThe authors thank Drs Zahir Amoura, Jean-Charles Piette and Henry Chabre for sharing their expertise in the field of nucleosomes and anti-nucleosome antibodies; and Dr Luis Felipe Flores-Suárez for his collaboration regarding the sera of patients with primary vasculitis.

To compare the utility of anti-chromatin antibodies for the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and as markers of disease activity. \r\nMethods. We included 73 consecutive patients (62 female) with SLE (four or more ACR criteria) of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis). As control groups we included 130 healthy blood donors and 261 patients with 11 systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD). Disease activity was assessed using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). A venous', ' blood sample was drawn to measure three anti-chromatin antibodies [anti-nucleosome (anti-NCS), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-histones (anti-HST)] by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. \r\nResults. The prevalence of anti-chromatin antibodies in SLE patients and healthy controls was 100 and 3% respectively for anti-NCS, 63 and 5% for anti-dsDNA, and 15 and 3% for anti-HST. Anti-NCS had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97% for SLE diagnosis. When SLE and SAD patients were compared [excluding mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)], the sensitivity of anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies for SLE diagnosis was 93, 71 and 40% respectively and the specificity was 97, 98 and 98%. Anti-chromatin antibodies were not useful in differentiating between SLE and MCTD patients. Anti-NCS antibodies showed the highest correlation with disease activity (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001), especially in patients negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.58, P = 0.001).

Anti-dsDNA antibodies are considered the main diagnostic tool', ' for SLE and a useful marker of disease activity; however, they are found only in 50% of SLE patients and do not always correlate with disease activity [2, 3]. On the other hand, antinuclear antibodies, the most prevalent antibodies, have low specificity for the diagnosis of SLE, because they are found in most systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) and even in healthy individuals [4]. Thus, it is important to look for other autoantibodies that may be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients. \r\nRecently, it was proposed that the nucleosome is the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE, and that anti-nucleosome antibodies (anti-NCS) are associated with organic damage [5\x967]. However, the sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for the diagnosis of SLE in patients with long disease duration have not been shown to be better than those of anti-dsDNA antibodies [8, 9]. \r\nIn the murine models of lupus, anti-NCS antibodies arise before the development of other anti-chromatin antibodies and they have the highest prevalence from the early stages of life [10]; therefore, we hypothesized that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients of recent onset. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nPatients and methods\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 73 consecutive patients who attended the lupus clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INCMNSZ) between August 1999 and November 2001, with SLE of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria [11]. All patients were evaluated by the same rheumatologist, who assessed disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [12]. A venous blood sample was drawn at the same visit and stored at -70°C to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG)-class anti-chromatin antibodies (anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST). As control groups we included (i) 130 healthy blood donors who tested', "" negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test) (56% females, mean age 34 ± 9 yr) and (ii) 261 prevalent patients with 11 SAD, including 50 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 31 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, 70 with primary vasculitis (Takayasu arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch\x96Schönlein purpura, Behçet disease and microscopic polyangiitis), 50 with primary Sjögren syndrome, 40 with inflammatory myopathy and 20 with systemic sclerosis, according to appropriate classification criteria [13\x9620]. \r\nAnti-chromatin antibodies were determined by immunoenzymatic assay (EIA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations [Orgentec Diagnostika (Germany) (anti-HST and anti-NCS antibodies) and The Binding Site (UK) (anti-dsDNA antibodies)]. Briefly, plates coated with purified human nucleosomes, histones or calf thymus dsDNA were incubated with 100 µl of 1:100 serum dilutions for 30 min at room temperature. Each plate included a calibration curve of five points, a positive control and a negative control. Plates were washed three times with the wash solutions of the kits. A prediluted anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 µl/well) was pipetted into the wells of the microplate and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. After three washes, 100 µl of prediluted substrate was added and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. Colour release was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of prediluted stop solution. Plates were read at 450 nm and a 650 nm reference filter was used. Reproducibility was evaluated using eight positive and negative controls (r = 0.98). Because contamination with Jo-1 in the human nucleosome EIA preparations has been reported (personal communication, Henry Chabre), we tested five anti-Jo-1-positive sera in the three anti-chromatin assays, and all samples were negative to anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA"", "" and anti-HST antibodies (data not shown). These results suggest that the preparation used for coating the plates was not contaminated with Jo-1. \r\nThe cut-off values of anti-chromatin antibodies were set above the mean ± 2 S.D. of a separate control group of 100 healthy individuals (55, 15 and 100 U/ml for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively). Because these values were not useful in differentiating between SAD and SLE patients, we used a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve considering the titres found in 73 SLE patients and 261 patients with rheumatic diseases. Antibody determinations were performed by one of the authors (JC), who was blinded to the clinical information. The study was approved by the Institutional Committee of Biomedical Research at the INCMNSZ. \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nTo determine the diagnostic utility of anti-chromatin antibodies, we used the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± S.D. Pairs of groups were compared using Student's t test for normally distributed continuous variables or the Mann\x96Whitney U test for those without normal distribution. The 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables as needed. For comparisons among three or more groups, an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test or its equivalent non-parametric test was used. As a secondary analysis, the correlation coefficient (Spearman) between anti-chromatin antibodies and disease activity was determined, using a modified SLEDAI in which anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement protein values were excluded to avoid overestimation of the coefficient. Statistical significance was set at P  0.05, two-tailed. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nResults\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe included 73 SLE patients [62 females (85%)] with age 25.6 ± 8.8 yr (range 15\x9661, median 24) and SLE duration 5.5 ± 2.9 months (range 2\x9612, median 5).

Therefore, anti-NCS antibodies were not useful for this task. \r\nCorrelation between anti-chromatin antibodies and SLE activity\r\nAll anti-chromatin antibodies correlated with SLE activity (Fig. 1). The correlation coefficient was stronger for anti-NCS antibodies (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) than for anti-HST (r = 0.28, P = 0.01) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.25, P = 0.03). \r\nView larger version (16K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 1.

High titres', ' of anti-NCS antibodies were associated with proteinuria [odds ratio (OR) 4.1, 95% CI 1.2\x9613.6, P = 0.01], haematuria (OR 4.2, 95% CI 1.1\x9615.4, P = 0.03), malar rash (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.1\x9619.1, P = 0.03), arthritis (OR 6.5, 95% CI 1.8\x9620.6, P = 0.003) and oral ulcers (OR 10.0, 95% CI 2.4\x9642.5, P = 0.001). High titres of anti-dsDNA antibodies were associated with oral ulcers (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.1\x9627.3, P = 0.02) and high titres of anti-HST antibodies were associated with pleuritis (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6\x962.7, P = 0.05) (Table 4). \r\nView this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nTABLE 4.

Considered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained almost 40% of SLE activity (r2 = 0.364, P < 0.001) (Fig. 3).  \r\nView larger version (19K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 3.

Traditional tests used in the diagnosis of SLE, such as antinuclear antibodies, have low specificity because they identify antibodies against nuclear antigens generically [4]. Because the nucleosomes have been considered the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE [5, 6, 21\x9623], we investigated the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in SLE patients with recent onset. \r\nIn this study, anti-NCS antibodies were detected in all SLE patients with recent onset. They showed a high correlation with disease activity, especially among SLE patients who tested negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies, and were strongly associated with renal damage. All the SLE patients we studied had anti-NCS antibodies, whereas anti-dsDNA antibodies were present in only 63%. Previous reports [8, 9], in which SLE patients with longer disease duration (mean 8 yr) were studied, did not show a higher prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies than anti-dsDNA antibodies. We cannot explain the discrepancy in the results between these previous studies and our study. Whether these differences depend on the effect of disease activity or SLE treatment on the antibody titres needs to be determined. \r\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for SLE diagnosis in our study is consistent with findings in murine models of lupus, in which it has been demonstrated that the development of anti-NCS antibodies occurs before other anti-chromatin antibodies [10]. Our results show that the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies is higher than that of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the initial stages. This is similar to what has been reported in murine models of lupus [10]. \r\nConsidered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained close to 40% of SLE activity. Anti-NCS antibodies themselves explained almost 35% of disease activity. These results suggest that anti-NCS antibodies, besides being potentially useful in SLE diagnosis, could be a biological marker of disease activity. \r\nThe presence of anti-NCS antibodies in all SLE patients who were anti-dsDNA-negative and the stronger correlation with disease activity needs to be highlighted, because in this group there is no reliable diagnostic test and no marker of disease activity. \r\nIn our study, only anti-NCS antibodies were associated with renal damage, which suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [24, 25].', ' A positive association of anti-NCS antibodies with renal damage has been demonstrated previously, both in murine models of lupus and in SLE [5, 6, 24, 25]. This association seems to depend on a complex interaction between charges associated with the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes and epitope targets in renal tissue. That is, the histones that constitute part of the nucleosomes have a cationic charge, whereas the glomerular basement membrane has an anionic charge, which permits an interaction between them. \r\nAs also reported by Amoura et al. [8] and Bruns et al. [9], in our study the presence of anti-NCS antibodies was restricted to patients with SLE and MCTD diagnoses. This suggests that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful not only in differentiating individuals with SLE from healthy individuals, but also in differentiating SLE from other forms of SAD. However, the high prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in MCTD restricted their utility in the differential diagnosis of SLE. Nevertheless, we cannot definitively rule out their usefulness in differentiating SLE and MCTD patients at early stages of disease evolution, because the MCTD patients studied did not have disease of recent onset. However, this result is interesting in view of the fact that MCTD and SLE share many clinical and biological characteristics. \r\nWe must acknowledge some limitations of this study. We did not test cross-reaction among anti-chromatin antibodies. However, in two previous reports it was demonstrated that this cross-reaction did not affect the interpretation of the test [8, 9]. Furthermore, we studied a group of SLE patients who were positive only for anti-NCS antibodies and negative for other anti-chromatin antibodies, which is clear evidence of the existence of a group of antibodies that recognize only the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes [26]. \r\nAlthough a strong correlation was found between anti-NCS antibodies and SLEDAI scores, given the cross-sectional nature of the study we were not able to determine whether the titres of anti-NCS antibodies are sensitive to change with disease activity over time. \r\nDespite these limitations, we may conclude that anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of SLE, especially at early stages of the disease, and a useful marker of disease activity, particularly in patients who are negative for anti-', 'dsDNA antibodies. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\xa0\r\nThe authors thank Drs Zahir Amoura, Jean-Charles Piette and Henry Chabre for sharing their expertise in the field of nucleosomes and anti-nucleosome antibodies; and Dr Luis Felipe Flores-Suárez for his collaboration regarding the sera of patients with primary vasculitis.

We included 73 consecutive patients (62 female) with SLE (four or more ACR criteria) of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis). As control groups we included 130 healthy blood donors and 261 patients with 11 systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD). Disease activity was assessed using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI). A venous', ' blood sample was drawn to measure three anti-chromatin antibodies [anti-nucleosome (anti-NCS), anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) and anti-histones (anti-HST)] by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. \r\nResults. The prevalence of anti-chromatin antibodies in SLE patients and healthy controls was 100 and 3% respectively for anti-NCS, 63 and 5% for anti-dsDNA, and 15 and 3% for anti-HST. Anti-NCS had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 97% for SLE diagnosis. When SLE and SAD patients were compared [excluding mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD)], the sensitivity of anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies for SLE diagnosis was 93, 71 and 40% respectively and the specificity was 97, 98 and 98%. Anti-chromatin antibodies were not useful in differentiating between SLE and MCTD patients. Anti-NCS antibodies showed the highest correlation with disease activity (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001), especially in patients negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.58, P = 0.001).

However, the sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for the diagnosis of SLE in patients with long disease duration have not been shown to be better than those of anti-dsDNA antibodies [8, 9]. \r\nIn the murine models of lupus, anti-NCS antibodies arise before the development of other anti-chromatin antibodies and they have the highest prevalence from the early stages of life [10]; therefore, we hypothesized that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful in the diagnosis and assessment of disease activity in SLE patients of recent onset. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nPatients and methods\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe conducted a cross-sectional study among 73 consecutive patients who attended the lupus clinic at the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INCMNSZ) between August 1999 and November 2001, with SLE of recent onset (<1 yr since diagnosis) according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria [11]. All patients were evaluated by the same rheumatologist, who assessed disease activity using the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [12]. A venous blood sample was drawn at the same visit and stored at -70°C to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG)-class anti-chromatin antibodies (anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST). As control groups we included (i) 130 healthy blood donors who tested', "" negative for HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses and VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide test) (56% females, mean age 34 ± 9 yr) and (ii) 261 prevalent patients with 11 SAD, including 50 with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), 31 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome, 70 with primary vasculitis (Takayasu arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, Henoch\x96Schönlein purpura, Behçet disease and microscopic polyangiitis), 50 with primary Sjögren syndrome, 40 with inflammatory myopathy and 20 with systemic sclerosis, according to appropriate classification criteria [13\x9620]. \r\nAnti-chromatin antibodies were determined by immunoenzymatic assay (EIA), according to the manufacturer's recommendations [Orgentec Diagnostika (Germany) (anti-HST and anti-NCS antibodies) and The Binding Site (UK) (anti-dsDNA antibodies)]. Briefly, plates coated with purified human nucleosomes, histones or calf thymus dsDNA were incubated with 100 µl of 1:100 serum dilutions for 30 min at room temperature. Each plate included a calibration curve of five points, a positive control and a negative control. Plates were washed three times with the wash solutions of the kits. A prediluted anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (100 µl/well) was pipetted into the wells of the microplate and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. After three washes, 100 µl of prediluted substrate was added and incubated for 30 min (dsDNA plates) or 15 min (histones and nucleosomes plates) at room temperature. Colour release was stopped by the addition of 100 µl of prediluted stop solution. Plates were read at 450 nm and a 650 nm reference filter was used. Reproducibility was evaluated using eight positive and negative controls (r = 0.98). Because contamination with Jo-1 in the human nucleosome EIA preparations has been reported (personal communication, Henry Chabre), we tested five anti-Jo-1-positive sera in the three anti-chromatin assays, and all samples were negative to anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA"", "" and anti-HST antibodies (data not shown). These results suggest that the preparation used for coating the plates was not contaminated with Jo-1. \r\nThe cut-off values of anti-chromatin antibodies were set above the mean ± 2 S.D. of a separate control group of 100 healthy individuals (55, 15 and 100 U/ml for anti-NCS, anti-dsDNA and anti-HST antibodies respectively). Because these values were not useful in differentiating between SAD and SLE patients, we used a ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve considering the titres found in 73 SLE patients and 261 patients with rheumatic diseases. Antibody determinations were performed by one of the authors (JC), who was blinded to the clinical information. The study was approved by the Institutional Committee of Biomedical Research at the INCMNSZ. \r\nStatistical analysis\r\nTo determine the diagnostic utility of anti-chromatin antibodies, we used the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and likelihood ratio. Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± S.D. Pairs of groups were compared using Student's t test for normally distributed continuous variables or the Mann\x96Whitney U test for those without normal distribution. The 2 test or Fisher's exact test was used for categorical variables as needed. For comparisons among three or more groups, an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test or its equivalent non-parametric test was used. As a secondary analysis, the correlation coefficient (Spearman) between anti-chromatin antibodies and disease activity was determined, using a modified SLEDAI in which anti-dsDNA antibodies and complement protein values were excluded to avoid overestimation of the coefficient. Statistical significance was set at P  0.05, two-tailed. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nResults\r\nTop\r\nAbstract\r\nIntroduction\r\nPatients and methods\r\nResults\r\nDiscussion\r\nReferences\r\n\xa0\r\nWe included 73 SLE patients [62 females (85%)] with age 25.6 ± 8.8 yr (range 15\x9661, median 24) and SLE duration 5.5 ± 2.9 months (range 2\x9612, median 5).

Therefore, anti-NCS antibodies were not useful for this task. \r\nCorrelation between anti-chromatin antibodies and SLE activity\r\nAll anti-chromatin antibodies correlated with SLE activity (Fig. 1). The correlation coefficient was stronger for anti-NCS antibodies (r = 0.45, P < 0.0001) than for anti-HST (r = 0.28, P = 0.01) and anti-dsDNA antibodies (r = 0.25, P = 0.03). \r\nView larger version (16K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFIG. 1.

Traditional tests used in the diagnosis of SLE, such as antinuclear antibodies, have low specificity because they identify antibodies against nuclear antigens generically [4]. Because the nucleosomes have been considered the principal antigen in the pathophysiology of SLE [5, 6, 21\x9623], we investigated the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in SLE patients with recent onset. \r\nIn this study, anti-NCS antibodies were detected in all SLE patients with recent onset. They showed a high correlation with disease activity, especially among SLE patients who tested negative for anti-dsDNA antibodies, and were strongly associated with renal damage. All the SLE patients we studied had anti-NCS antibodies, whereas anti-dsDNA antibodies were present in only 63%. Previous reports [8, 9], in which SLE patients with longer disease duration (mean 8 yr) were studied, did not show a higher prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies than anti-dsDNA antibodies. We cannot explain the discrepancy in the results between these previous studies and our study. Whether these differences depend on the effect of disease activity or SLE treatment on the antibody titres needs to be determined. \r\nThe high sensitivity and specificity of anti-NCS antibodies for SLE diagnosis in our study is consistent with findings in murine models of lupus, in which it has been demonstrated that the development of anti-NCS antibodies occurs before other anti-chromatin antibodies [10]. Our results show that the prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies is higher than that of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the initial stages. This is similar to what has been reported in murine models of lupus [10]. \r\nConsidered together, anti-chromatin antibodies explained close to 40% of SLE activity. Anti-NCS antibodies themselves explained almost 35% of disease activity. These results suggest that anti-NCS antibodies, besides being potentially useful in SLE diagnosis, could be a biological marker of disease activity. \r\nThe presence of anti-NCS antibodies in all SLE patients who were anti-dsDNA-negative and the stronger correlation with disease activity needs to be highlighted, because in this group there is no reliable diagnostic test and no marker of disease activity. \r\nIn our study, only anti-NCS antibodies were associated with renal damage, which suggests a possible role in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis [24, 25].', ' A positive association of anti-NCS antibodies with renal damage has been demonstrated previously, both in murine models of lupus and in SLE [5, 6, 24, 25]. This association seems to depend on a complex interaction between charges associated with the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes and epitope targets in renal tissue. That is, the histones that constitute part of the nucleosomes have a cationic charge, whereas the glomerular basement membrane has an anionic charge, which permits an interaction between them. \r\nAs also reported by Amoura et al. [8] and Bruns et al. [9], in our study the presence of anti-NCS antibodies was restricted to patients with SLE and MCTD diagnoses. This suggests that anti-NCS antibodies could be useful not only in differentiating individuals with SLE from healthy individuals, but also in differentiating SLE from other forms of SAD. However, the high prevalence of anti-NCS antibodies in MCTD restricted their utility in the differential diagnosis of SLE. Nevertheless, we cannot definitively rule out their usefulness in differentiating SLE and MCTD patients at early stages of disease evolution, because the MCTD patients studied did not have disease of recent onset. However, this result is interesting in view of the fact that MCTD and SLE share many clinical and biological characteristics. \r\nWe must acknowledge some limitations of this study. We did not test cross-reaction among anti-chromatin antibodies. However, in two previous reports it was demonstrated that this cross-reaction did not affect the interpretation of the test [8, 9]. Furthermore, we studied a group of SLE patients who were positive only for anti-NCS antibodies and negative for other anti-chromatin antibodies, which is clear evidence of the existence of a group of antibodies that recognize only the quaternary structure of the nucleosomes [26]. \r\nAlthough a strong correlation was found between anti-NCS antibodies and SLEDAI scores, given the cross-sectional nature of the study we were not able to determine whether the titres of anti-NCS antibodies are sensitive to change with disease activity over time. \r\nDespite these limitations, we may conclude that anti-NCS antibodies could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of SLE, especially at early stages of the disease, and a useful marker of disease activity, particularly in patients who are negative for anti-', 'dsDNA antibodies. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\xa0\r\nThe authors thank Drs Zahir Amoura, Jean-Charles Piette and Henry Chabre for sharing their expertise in the field of nucleosomes and anti-nucleosome antibodies; and Dr Luis Felipe Flores-Suárez for his collaboration regarding the sera of patients with primary vasculitis.

Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to recombinant
tropoelastin in an EDTA insensitive manner. By comparison, we show that
vascular smooth muscle cell migration to collagen, which is mediated by
integrins, is EDTA sensitive. (B) Tropoelastin mediated actin polymerization
of Eln-/- cells is EDTA insensitive. (C) Migration of
Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells towards tropoelastin
is pertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments with the B protomer of
pertussis toxin alone demonstrate that the effect of pertussis toxin is
specific to its ability to inhibit G-protein signaling. The migration of
Eln-/- cells to PDGF (30 ng/ml) is insensitive to
pertussis toxin. This control experiment demonstrates that
Eln-/- cells treated with pertussis toxin can respond
normally to stimuli other than tropoelastin. (D) Tropoelastin-mediated actin
polymerization of Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells is
pertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments demonstrate that the B protomer
of pertussis toxin does not inhibit actin polymerization. Together, these
experiments indicate that tropoelastin regulates vascular smooth muscle cells
through a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein signaling pathway. (E) Cholera
toxin (ctxn) and forskolin (frskln) increase the baseline levels of cAMP in
Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells by constitutive
activation of the Gs pathway. In the presence of tropoelastin and
forskolin, there is a marked decrease in cAMP. A similar decrease in cAMP
levels is observed when tropoelastin is added to cholera toxin pretreated
cells.

This fibrocellular response has largely been\r\nattributed to the release of multiple cytokines and growth factors by\r\ninflammatory cells. Previously, we demonstrated that the disruption of the\r\nel', 'astin matrix leads to defective arterial morphogenesis. Here, we propose\r\nthat elastin is a potent autocrine regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nactivity and that this regulation is important for preventing fibrocellular\r\npathology. Using vascular smooth muscle cells from mice lacking elastin\r\n(Eln-/-), we show that elastin induces actin stress fiber\r\norganization, inhibits proliferation, regulates migration and signals via a\r\nnon-integrin, heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled pathway. In a porcine coronary\r\nmodel of restenosis, the therapeutic delivery of exogenous elastin to injured\r\nvessels in vivo significantly reduces neointimal formation. These findings\r\nindicate that elastin stabilizes the arterial structure by inducing a\r\nquiescent contractile state in vascular smooth muscle cells. Together, this\r\nwork demonstrates that signaling pathways crucial for arterial morphogenesis\r\ncan play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of vascular\r\ndisease. \r\nKey words: Elastin matrix, Vascular smooth muscle, Morphogenesis, G-protein signaling, Vascular proliferative diseases\r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nVascular proliferative diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that\r\ninclude atherosclerosis, coronary restenosis, bypass-graft failure and\r\ntransplant arteriopathy that lead to arterial narrowing, restriction of blood\r\nflow and tissue ischemia. These diseases arise from a complex\r\npathophysiological response to injury by multiple factors, including\r\nhypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, hypertension and mechanical injury\r\n(Ross, 1995;\r\nLusis, 2000). Although their\r\netiologies are diverse, these disorders all share a common pathological\r\nfeature: the accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells and fibrous\r\nconnective tissue within the intima between the endothelium and medial layer\r\nof the vessel wall (Lusis,\r\n2000; Raines and Ross,\r\n1993). This fibrocellular pathology, known as neointimal\r\nformation, results from the activation, proliferation and migration', ' of\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (Raines and\r\nRoss, 1993; Schwartz,\r\n1997). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell regulation is crucial for developing strategies to\r\nprevent and treat vascular proliferative disorders. \r\n \r\nVascular smooth muscle cells are not terminally differentiated and can\r\nalternate between a quiescent, contractile state and a proliferative\r\nnon-contractile state (Raines and Ross,\r\n1993; Owens, 1998;\r\nThyberg, 1998). In a healthy\r\nartery, vascular smooth muscle cells are quiescent and largely comprise a\r\ncontractile apparatus that functions to dilate and constrict the lumen as\r\nrequired by physiological demands. Actin stress fibers serve as the scaffold\r\nfor the contractile apparatus, and are a hallmark of mature and quiescent\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (Burridge and\r\nChrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996;\r\nSmall and Gimona, 1998). Under\r\ncircumstances of injury, repair and regeneration, vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nlose their contractile apparatus and dedifferentiate into an immature\r\nphenotype capable of proliferating and depositing extracellular matrix\r\n(Owens, 1998;\r\nThyberg, 1998). This\r\nfibrocellular response plays an important role in all forms of vascular\r\nproliferative diseases. In atherosclerotic lesions, the major components of\r\nthe fibrous plaque are vascular smooth muscle cells, the matrix products\r\ndeposited by these cells, and extracellular cholesterol\r\n(Ross, 1995;\r\nLusis, 2000;\r\nRaines and Ross, 1993). In\r\nrestenosis, transplant arteriopathy and vascular graft disease; smooth muscle\r\ncells are the predominant component of the occlusive lesion\r\n(Raines and Ross, 1993). The\r\nphenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells offers a tempting target\r\nfor preventing vascular proliferative diseases. \r\nElastin is the dominant extracellular matrix protein deposited in the\r\narterial wall and can contribute up to 50% of its dry weight\r\n(Parks et al., 1993). The\r\nprotein product of the elastin gene is synthesized by vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells', ' and secreted as a monomer, tropoelastin. After post-translational\r\nmodification, tropoelastin is crosslinked and organized into elastin polymers\r\nthat form concentric rings of elastic lamellae around the arterial lumen. Each\r\nelastic lamella alternates with a ring of smooth muscle, and provides the\r\ncompliance that arteries need to absorb and transmit hemodynamic force\r\n(Wolinski et al., 1967). There\r\nis a growing body of evidence that implicates elastin in vascular development\r\nand disease. We previously demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations of one\r\nelastin allele cause supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and Williams-Beuren\r\nSyndrome (Li et al., 1997;\r\nCurran et al., 1993;\r\nEwart et al., 1993). These\r\ndisorders are characterized by discrete fibrocellular stenoses in the aorta,\r\ncoronary arteries, carotid arteries, pulmonary arteries and other peripheral\r\narteries. Often, individuals with these diseases are young children who are\r\nsusceptible to peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarctions or stroke\r\nin the absence of other risk factors such as high serum cholesterol, diabetes\r\nand cigarette smoking (van Son et al.,\r\n1994). In subsequent experiments, we showed that the deposition of\r\nelastin matrix in the arterial wall during late fetal development is essential\r\nto arterial morphogenesis (Li et al.,\r\n1998). Mice that lack elastin (Eln-/-) died\r\nfrom occlusive fibrocellular pathology caused by subendothelial proliferation\r\nand accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in early neonatal life. In\r\nEln-/- vessels, there is no evidence of abnormal\r\nendothelial structure, activation or proliferation. Furthermore, the occlusive\r\nvascular phenotype occurred in the absence of hemodynamic stress and\r\ninflammation. This work demonstrated that elastin is required for arterial\r\ndevelopment. However, because the absence of elastin undoubtedly distorts the\r\npresentation and stability of other important elements of the matrix\r\narchitecture, these studies failed to define the specific role for elastin in\r\nestablishing and maintaining a mature artery. \r', ""\nHere we show that elastin regulates the phenotypic modulation,\r\nproliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. We\r\nconfirm a direct signaling effect by demonstrating that elastin regulates\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells via a G-protein-coupled signaling pathway.\r\nFinally, we establish that in vivo, exogenous elastin reduces the vascular\r\nproliferative response of an injured artery. These results demonstrate that\r\nelastin is a crucial signaling molecule that directly controls vascular smooth\r\nmuscle biology and stabilizes arterial structure. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nIsolation of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nNewborn (postnatal day 0.5) Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- pups were sacrificed by CO2\r\nasphyxiation. Their ascending aortas were dissected free, endothelium removed\r\nand placed into individual wells of a plastic 12-well culture dish containing\r\nAmniomax C-100 growth medium (Gibco-BRL) supplemented with\r\npenicillin/streptomycin. Cultures of smooth muscle cells that formed around\r\nthe tissue were trypsinized (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA), passaged, expanded\r\nand genotyped to confirm their identity. Cells were stained with SM\r\n-actin (Clone 1A4, Sigma) and checked for classic `hill-and-valley'\r\nmorphology to confirm their smooth muscle status. In situ hybridization,\r\nimmunostaining and RT/PCR analysis established that these cells expressed the\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell markers SM -actin, SM -actin, SM-22,\r\ncalponin, desmin, ang-1/ang-2, and did not express the endothelial markers\r\nFlk-1 or Flt-1. \r\nCellular assays\r\nCellular experiments of proliferation, actin polymerization and migration\r\ndescribed below were performed on at least three independently isolated\r\nprimary cell lines. Proliferation was assayed by"", ' cell count and\r\n[3H]thymidine incorporation. Confluent cultures of\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells from the fourth passage were seeded at a density of\r\n2x103 cells/well on a plastic 24-well plate (Corning Costar,\r\nCorning, NY), and stimulated to proliferate in AmnioMAX C-100 growth medium\r\n(Gibco-BRL) treated with 100 µg/ml recombinant tropoelastin or left\r\nuntreated. Cell numbers for each culture were assayed by hemocytometer after\r\n24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. For [3H]thymidine incorporation,\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- cells were seeded at\r\na density of 20,000 cells/well on a 24-well plate. After attachment, cells\r\nwere starved in 0.1% BSA (Fisher) in Amniomax Basal Medium (Gibco) for 24\r\nhours. Cells were then grown in whole Amniomax medium treated/untreated with\r\n100 µg/ml tropoelastin (Grosso et al., 1991a). Cells were assayed for\r\n[3H]thymidine incorporation using a scintillation counter after 24\r\nhours by precipitating with 5% TCA, followed by NaOH solubilization. Data were\r\ncalculated as mean±s.d. (n=6). \r\nSubconfluent cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells were evaluated and\r\nscored for the presence of actin stress fibers in the cytoplasm following\r\nimmunofluorescent staining for SM -actin (Clone 1A4, Sigma), vinculin\r\n(Clone hVin-1, Sigma), desmin (Sigma) and tubulin (Clone DM-1A, Calbiochem).\r\nCells were treated with tropoelastin (1 µg/ml) (Grosso et al., 1991a) or\r\nnot, and assays were performed in serum-free media. Cells were scored as\r\ncontractile if they had distinct actin stress fibers continuous throughout the\r\ncytoplasm, or at least 10 well-defined focal adhesions distributed throughout\r\nthe cytoplasm and cell', ' periphery. Scoring was performed by three separate\r\nobservers blinded to the cell genotypes, and their numbers averaged. At least\r\n100 cells were scored in three separate cultures for each genotype.\r\nAdditionally, identical results were obtained for cells cultured on glass\r\nslides, 24 plastic tissue culture plates (Corning) coated with matrigel, and\r\nanother brand of plasticware (Falcon). \r\nThe chemotactic activity of cells was assayed in a modification of the\r\nBoyden chamber method using 6.5 mm transwell polycarbonate chemotaxis filter\r\ninserts in a plastic 24-well tissue culture plate (Corning Costar, Corning,\r\nNY). Various concentrations of recombinant tropoelastin (Grosso et al., 1991a)\r\nwere placed in both the upper or lower compartment and covered with a\r\npolycarbonate membrane filter (8 µm porosity). PDGF-BB (30 ng/ml) was added\r\nto the lower chamber and served as a positive control. Medium alone was used\r\nas the negative control. Cells to be tested were placed in the upper wells of\r\nthe chamber and incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 3 hours. After\r\nincubation, the cells adhering to the upper surface of the filter were scraped\r\noff and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface were fixed with 10%\r\nbuffered formalin, stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and viewed\r\nunder a mercury lamp. Fifteen randomly selected high power (x200) fields\r\nwere counted on each filter by observers blinded to their conditions.\r\nChemotactic response was measured as the number of cells that had transversed\r\nthe filter in response to tropoelastin, PDGF and collagen type I (10\r\nµg/ml), and expressed as fold increase over baseline. Each condition was\r\nassayed in triplicate wells and each experiment was repeated at least three\r\ntimes. Actin polymerization and migration assays experiments were also\r\nperformed in triplicate in the presence of 100 µM Actinomycin D\r\n(Calbiochem), 10 µg/ml Cycloheximide (Calbiochem), 20 µM Y27632\r\n(Welfide), 20 µM ED', 'TA, 100 ng/ml Ptxn (Calbiochem) or 100 ng/ml B-protomer\r\n(Calbiochem). \r\nMeasurement of cAMP and activated Rho A\r\nAll biochemical measurements were performed in cells that were serum\r\nstarved overnight. cAMP assay levels were detected using an RIA kit (RPA538,\r\nAmersham Pharmacia). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 80,000 to\r\n100,000 cells on a plastic 12-well cell-culture plate, pretreated with 100\r\nng/ml cholera toxin (Calbiochem) for 3 hours, treated with 1 µg/ml\r\nrecombinant tropoelastin for 20 minutes, and cAMP subsequently isolated.\r\nExperimental cAMP levels were quantified through use of a standard curve where\r\nknown amounts of cAMP were added to radioimmunoassay. \r\nRhoA-GTP was detected using a Rho Activation Kit (Upstate Biotechnology).\r\nBriefly, Eln-/- cells were grown to 70% confluence in a\r\nsix-well plate, and pretreated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin or 100 ng/ml\r\nB-protomer for 3 hours. Control experiments with no pretreatment were also\r\nperformed. Cells were then treated with 1 µg/ml recombinant tropoelastin\r\nfor 3 hours and activated Rho A was isolated by immunoprecipitations with\r\nRhotekin coated beads. RhoA-GTP was detected by western blot analysis after\r\nsamples were run on a 10% acryllamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose\r\nmembranes. Equal amounts of total cellular lysate were run out for each sample\r\nto ensure that equivalent amounts of protein were used in all experiments. \r\nPorcine coronary model of in-stent restenosis\r\nElastin sheaths were prepared from dissected common carotid arteries of\r\nadult domestic swine (40 to 60 kg) using a variation of a previously published\r\nprotocol (Malone et al.,\r\n1984). Briefly, these vessels were sequentially treated with a 1%\r\nSDS solution supplemented with doxycycline (10 mg/l) and EDTA (5 mM),', '\r\npotassium hydroxide (5 N) at 60°C, collagenase solution (0.5 mg/ml,\r\nCollagenase D, Roche), autoclaved and  irradiated. The product of these\r\nextractions, a tubular elastin matrix sheath, was cut to size and fitted over\r\n14 mm long stainless steel expandable stents (Medtronic AVE, S670) mounted on\r\n3.5 mm diameter angioplasty balloons and secured by a metal coil. Control\r\nstents deployed were identical to elastin covered stents except for the\r\nabsence of elastin sheaths. \r\nNineteen domestic pigs (30 to 40 kg) on a normal diet were pretreated with\r\noral aspirin (625 mg), ticlopidine (250 mg) and verapamil (120 mg), and placed\r\nunder general anesthesia. Animals underwent placement of 32 stents in the left\r\nanterior descending, circumflex or right coronary artery. The methods of stent\r\nimplantation have been previously described\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1994).\r\nBriefly, control stents or elastin sheath-covered stents were advanced under\r\nfluoroscopic guidance to an appropriate site in the coronary vasculature and\r\ndeployed at a 1.2:1 to 1.4:1 stent-to-artery ratio compared with the baseline\r\nvessel diameter. After the procedure, the wounds were closed and the pigs were\r\nreturned to their quarters on a normal diet. Pigs were sacrificed at day 3\r\n(elastin-covered stent, n=2) and day 14 (elastin-covered stent,\r\nn=2) to assess biocompatibility of the elastin sheath. To study\r\nneointima formation, pigs were sacrificed at day 28 (control stents,\r\nn=15; elastin-covered stents, n=14) and instrumented\r\narteries were removed. Coronary arteries were fixed by pressure perfusion (100\r\nmm Hg) with 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours, dissected free, washed,\r\ndehydrated through graded alcohols and infiltrated with methylmethacrylate\r\n(MMA) at 4°C. After polymerization,', ' embedded specimens were\r\ncross-sectioned at 5 µm thickness using a tungsten-carbide microtome blade.\r\nEach arterial segment was stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and elastic Van\r\nGieson stains. Three cross-sections taken from the two ends and the middle of\r\neach artery were used for histomorphometric analysis. Histological examination\r\nconfirmed that the elastin sheaths were retained in the arterial wall of all\r\nspecimens. \r\nHistomorphometric analysis\r\nMean neointimal thickness, percent stenosis and mean injury score were\r\nmeasured on Van Gieson-stained sections using calibrated digital microscopic\r\nplanimetry as previously described\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1992;\r\nSchwartz et al., 1994).\r\nBriefly, the mean neointimal thickness was measured by drawing a radial line\r\nfrom the lumen border to the point maximum penetration for each stent strut,\r\nand averaging the measurements. Percent area stenosis was calculated as %\r\nstenosis=100 x [1-(stenotic lumen area/original lumen area)]. The\r\noriginal lumen area was measured as the area subtended within the internal\r\nelastic lamina. The injury score measures the physical penetration of the\r\nstent strut into the vessel wall and was calculated using a graded scale from\r\n0-3 as previously described (Schwartz et\r\nal., 1992). Briefly, a score of 1 indicated that only the internal\r\nelastic lamina was lacerated; a score of 2 indicated laceration of the\r\narterial media; and a score of 3 indicated that the external elastic lamina\r\nwas lacerated. The mean injury score for each histological section was\r\ncalculated as mean injury score= injury scores for every strut/number\r\nof struts present per section. \r\nStatistics\r\nFor all in vitro experiments, mean and standard deviations were calculated\r\nand statistical analysis were carried out by analysis of variance (ANOVA). For\r\nin vivo experiments, statistical analysis was performed on injury score,\r\naverage neointimal thickness and percent lumen stenosis using regression\r\nmodeling (Schwartz et al.,\r\n1994). Linear regression modeling accounts for injury (a strong\r\ncovariate) and the injury-dependent ne', 'ointimal thickening between control\r\narteries and elastin treated arteries. Three models were used to establish\r\nwhether there were: (1) differences in intercepts, (2) differences in slopes\r\nallowing any intercept or (3) differences in slopes when the intercepts are\r\nfixed. Differences between the elastin sheath-stent and control stent at each\r\ninjury level were analyzed using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons\r\nt test for all three regression models. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nRESULTS\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nElastin inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells\r\nInvestigating the role of elastin in regulating vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells is confounded by the fact that these cells synthesize and secrete\r\nelastin. Thus, to determine the role of elastin in regulating cellular\r\nproliferation, differentiation and migration, we isolated vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells from mice lacking elastin (Eln-/-) and from\r\nwild-type sibling control animals (Eln+/+).\r\nImmunofluorescent staining and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction\r\n(RT-PCR) analyses established that Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells expressed and synthesized elastin (antibody to murine elastin\r\nkindly provided by Dr Robert Mecham, Washington University), whereas\r\nEln-/- cells did not\r\n(Fig. 1A-C). \r\nView larger version (64K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 1. Elastin inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. (A) RT-PCR\r\nexperiments confirm that murine vascular smooth muscle cells lines express\r\ncell specific markers. The elastin gene product is detected in\r\nEln+/+ and not Eln-/- cells.\r\nImmunofluorescence analysis with elastin antibodies and accompanying phase\r\nphotomicrographs demonstrate that Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (B) synthesize and secrete elastin matrix, whereas\r\nEln', '-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (C) do not produce\r\nelastin. (D) Assay measuring cell numbers demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate at a much\r\nhigher rate than do Eln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(P<0.0001, ANOVA). This difference is eliminated by the addition\r\nof recombinant elastin gene product or tropoelastin (tEln). (E) Assay\r\nmeasuring [3H]thymidine incorporation assay demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate at a rate\r\nover twofold greater than that for Eln+/+ cells. This\r\ndifference is eliminated by the inhibition of Eln-/- cells\r\nproliferation by tropoelastin (P<0.0001, ANOVA).\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo evaluate the role of elastin in vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nproliferation, we compared the growth rate of Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells. Cells were seeded at the same density and\r\ngrowth rates were assayed by counting cells after 24, 48 and 72 hours. The\r\nnumber of Eln-/- cells was greater than\r\nEln+/+ cells at all time points, and was increased over\r\ntwofold at 72 hours (Fig. 1D).\r\nThese data indicate that in the absence of elastin synthesis, vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells proliferate at an increased rate. \r\nTo prove the specificity of the effect of elastin on vascular smooth muscle\r\ncell growth, we tested whether adding exogenous recombinant tropoelastin to\r\nthe culture media inhibits cellular proliferation. Recombinant tropoelastin\r\nwas synthesized using a bacterial expression system (Grosso et al., 1991a) and\r\ndetermined to be pure by gel electrophoresis and amino acid composition.\r\nTropoelastin had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation, with a\r\nmaximal effect at 100 µg/ml (Fig.\r\n1D; data not shown). At this dose, the number of\r\nEln-/- cells was nearly identical to\r\nEln+/+ cells at 72 hours. At each time point, more than\r\n98% of all cells were viable as determined by Try', 'pan Blue staining, indicating\r\nthat tropoelastin was not cytotoxic. Similar results were observed when acid\r\nhydrolyzed elastic fibers,  elastin, were used for this assay. The\r\nresponses of Eln+/+ and Eln-/-\r\ncellular proliferation to tropoelastin\r\n(Fig. 1E) and  elastin\r\n(data not shown) were reproduced in [3H]thymidine incorporation\r\nassays. By comparison, there was no significant inhibitory effect on\r\nproliferation when Eln-/- cells were treated with type I\r\ncollagen (100 µg/ml) (data not shown). These data demonstrate that elastin\r\nregulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. \r\nElastin induces a mature contractile phenotype in vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells\r\nThe primary function of mature differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nis contraction. This ability requires highly organized actin myofilaments,\r\noften referred to as actin stress fibers\r\n(Burridge et al., 1996;\r\nSmall and Gimona, 1998). To\r\ndetermine if elastin modulates the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells,\r\nwe evaluated actin organization in Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells using direct immunofluorescent staining with\r\nFITC-conjugated SM -actin antisera. Well-defined actin myofilaments\r\nwere apparent in more than 95% of Eln+/+ cells scored by\r\nobservers blinded to genotype (Fig.\r\n2A,E). By contrast, only 23% of Eln-/- cells\r\nhad actin stress fibers (Fig.\r\n2B,E). Furthermore, Eln-/- cells with actin\r\nstress fibers were qualitatively different than Eln+/+\r\ncells, with a distinctive, rounder morphology (data not shown). These data\r\nindicate that vascular smooth muscle cells lacking elastin fail to organize\r\ntheir contractile apparatus. \r\nView larger version (57K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 2. Elastin induces a mature contractile phenotype in vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells. (A-E) Immunofluorescence analysis for SM -', 'actin reveals that\r\nEln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells (A) have a highly\r\norganized network of actin stress fibers, a hallmark of mature contractile\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells. By contrast, there is a paucity of actin stress\r\nfibers in Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (B; outlined\r\nby white dots). The elastin gene product, recombinant tropoelastin, induces\r\nthe formation of organized actin stress fibers in Eln-/-\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (D), but does not affect\r\nEln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells (C). Scoring analysis\r\ndemonstrates a significant increase in the percentage of\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells with organized actin\r\nmyofilaments after elastin treatment (P<0.0001) (E). Tropoelastin\r\nmediated actin polymerization is unaffected when Eln-/-\r\ncells are treated with either a gene transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D,\r\nor a protein translation inhibitor, cycloheximide. The Rho kinase inhibitor,\r\nY27632, blocks actin polymerization of tropoelastin treated\r\nEln-/- cells. (F-J) Immunofluorescence analysis for\r\nvinculin reveals that Eln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(F) have well-defined focal adhesions (arrowheads). By contrast,\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (G; outlined by white\r\ndots) have poorly defined focal adhesions. Tropoelastin induces well-defined\r\nfocal adhesions (arrows) throughout Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (I), but does not affect Eln+/+ vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells (H). Scoring analysis revealed a significant increase\r\n(P<0.0001) in the percentage of Eln-/-\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells with defined focal adhesions after tropoelastin\r\ntreatment (J). (K,L) Immunofluorescence staining with antisera against tubulin\r\nreveals no difference between Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (K) and Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(L). Exposure times for all images are the same.', ' Results represent the\r\nmean±s.d. from three individual experiments.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo confirm that the failure to form an organized contractile apparatus in\r\nEln-/- cells resulted from the inability to synthesize and\r\nsecrete elastin, we treated these cells with recombinant tropoelastin protein.\r\nWithin 3 hours of exposure to tropoelastin, the percentage of\r\nEln-/- cells with organized actin stress fibers increased\r\nthreefold to 74% (Fig. 2D,E).\r\nThis response was does dependent and was also seen by phallodin staining for\r\nF-actin (data not shown). By comparison, tropoelastin treatment had not effect\r\non actin stress fiber organization in Eln+/+ cells\r\n(Fig. 2C,E). Similar results\r\nwere observed when Eln-/- cells were treated with\r\ncrosslinked  elastin (data not shown). However, no change in actin\r\nstress fiber organization was observed when Eln-/- cells\r\nwere treated with an equivalent concentration of type I collagen. In addition,\r\nthe induction of actin polymerization by tropoelastin was unaffected by the\r\npresence or absence of serum in culture (data not shown). Thus, extracellular\r\nelastin is an important mediator of actin polymerization and contractile\r\napparatus organization in vascular smooth muscle cells. \r\nThe Rho signal transduction pathway is known to be a central converging\r\nstep in the formation of actin stress fibers through a post-translational\r\nmechanism (Mack et al., 2001;\r\nBishop and Hall, 2000). We\r\ninvestigated the role of this pathway in the regulation by tropoelastin of\r\nactin polymerization. The addition of actinomycin D\r\n(Greenburg et al., 1986), an\r\ninhibitor of gene transcription, or cycloheximide\r\n(Greenburg et al., 1986), an\r\ninhibitor of protein translation, did not block tropoelastin-induced actin\r\npolymerization in Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 2E). Furthermore, a\r\nspecific inhibitor of the Rho signaling pathway that targets Rho kinase,\r\nY276', '32 (Mack et al., 2001;\r\nUshata et al., 1997), blocked\r\ntropoelastin mediated actin polymerization of Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 2E). Additionally,\r\ntropoelastin treatment of Eln-/- vsmc did not alter the\r\namount of SM  actin transcript or protein levels as quantified by\r\nnorthern and western blot analysis but did shift the filamentous:globular\r\n(F:G) actin ratio from 1:1 to 3.1:1 (data not shown). These experiments, in\r\ncombination with the failure of either transcription or translation inhibitors\r\nto inhibit tropoelastin-induced actin stress fiber formation in\r\nEln-/- vsmc, suggest that elastin modulates vsmc phenotype\r\nby regulating actin treadmilling via a signal transduction pathway involving\r\nRho GTPases and their effector proteins. \r\nTo evaluate further the effect of elastin on the contractile phenotype in\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells, we examined the organization of vinculin,\r\ntubulin and desmin in Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells (Burridge\r\net al., 1996). Vinculin is concentrated in focal adhesion plaques\r\nthat bind the actin cytoskeleton and connect with the cell membrane. Indirect\r\nimmunofluorescent staining for vinculin revealed abundant focal adhesion\r\nplaques in 94% of Eln+/+ cells when scored by observers\r\nblinded to genotype (Fig.\r\n2F,J). By contrast, only 12% of Eln-/- cells\r\nhad a normal distribution of defined focal adhesion plaques\r\n(Fig. 2G,J). Within 3 hours of\r\nexposure to recombinant tropoelastin protein, the percentage of\r\nEln-/- cells with defined focal adhesions increased 6-fold\r\nto 79% (Fig. 2I,J). Treatment\r\nhad no effect on focal adhesion organization in Eln+/+\r\ncells (Fig. 2H,J).\r\nImmunostaining for other cytoskeletal proteins, tubulin\r\n(Fig. 2K,L) and desmin (data\r\nnot shown) showed no difference between Eln+/+', ' and\r\nEln-/- cells. Thus, the loss of elastin in vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells does not lead to a broad disruption of cytoskeletal architecture.\r\nThese results indicate that elastin induces a mature, contractile phenotype in\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells by regulating the organization of specific\r\ncytoskeletal proteins. \r\nElastin controls the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nVascular proliferative disease involves the migration of smooth muscle\r\ncells from the arterial media to the subendothelial space, forming a neointima\r\n(Schwartz, 1997). The same\r\nphenomenon is observed during the development of Eln-/-\r\narteries. We postulated that the elastin matrix surrounding each concentric\r\nlayer of vascular smooth muscle cells provides a cue that localizes these\r\ncells to the arterial media, and prevents their migration to the neointima. To\r\ntest this hypothesis, we used a modified Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay. We\r\ndiscovered that vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to tropoelastin in a\r\ndose-dependent manner (Fig.\r\n3A). Cell migration depended on the concentration gradient of\r\ntropoelastin, not the total amount used in the assay. Chemotaxis was minimal\r\nfor cells in control (0/0 ng/ml) and static fields of tropoelastin (200/200\r\nng/ml), but increased significantly as the concentration gradient of\r\ntropoelastin rose to 200 ng/ml. A similar but less dramatic effect was seen\r\nwith cells that produce elastin (Fig.\r\n3A), suggesting that the synthesis and secretion of elastin by\r\nEln+/+ cells reduced migration to external stimuli. These\r\ndata demonstrate that elastin is a potent chemoattractant for vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells. \r\nView larger version (18K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 3. Elastin controls migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. (A)\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells migrate to tropoelastin in a concentration-dependent manner,\r\nindicating that tropoelastin is a specific and direct stimulus for vascular', '\r\nsmooth muscle cell localization. In addition, Eln-/- cells\r\nconsistently migrated at a higher rate than Eln+/+ cells,\r\nsuggesting that the autocrine production of elastin by\r\nEln+/+ cells reduces their chemotaxis to external stimuli.\r\n(B) Tropoelastin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell migration to the\r\nchemotactic growth factor PDGF. A modified Boyden chamber assay was used for\r\nall experiments to determine the total number of migrated cells in 15 randomly\r\nselected high power microscope fields (HPF). Data shown are the\r\nmean±s.e.m. from three independent wells.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nCytokines and growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor\r\n(PDGF), are thought to mediate the subendothelial migration of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells in occlusive vascular lesions\r\n(Lusis, 2000;\r\nBornfeldt et al., 1993). To\r\ndetermine if elastin matrix deposited in the arterial media can counteract the\r\npotent chemotactic activity of PDGF, we repeated the Boyden chamber\r\nexperiments. At a PDGF concentration of 30 ng/ml, Eln-/-\r\ncells showed a fourfold increase in chemotactic activity\r\n(Fig. 3B). Increasing\r\nconcentrations of tropoelastin prevented Eln-/- cell\r\nmigration towards PDGF (Fig.\r\n3B). Similar results were observed in Eln+/+\r\ncells. These data suggest that elastin provides a local cue that prevents\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells from migrating away from the arterial media to\r\nthe subendothelial space. Together, these in vitro experiments demonstrate\r\nthat elastin is a potent and specific regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nmaturation, migration and proliferation. \r\nElastin signals via a non-integrin, G-protein coupled signaling\r\npathway\r\nTo determine whether elastin has a direct signaling effect, we examined the\r\nmolecular mechanism of the regulation by elastin of vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells. Though various binding proteins, chaperones and other matrix elements\r\nthat interact with elastin have been identified and cloned, the mechanism of\r\nelastin signaling remains', ' to be elucidated\r\n(Mecham and Hinek, 1986;\r\nHinek et al., 1988;\r\nMecham et al., 1991; Grosso et\r\nal., 1991b; Hinek, 1995;\r\nHinek, 1996;\r\nPrivitera et al., 1998). Using\r\nin vitro assays of migration and actin polymerization, we examined the\r\nsignaling cascade stimulated by elastin in Eln-/- vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells. Above, we demonstrate that elastin mediates actin\r\npolymerization through a Rho mediated signal transduction pathway\r\n(Fig. 2E). Cell-surface\r\nreceptors that are known to regulate the Rho signaling pathway include the\r\nintegrins and G-protein-coupled receptors\r\n(Seasholtz et al., 1999;\r\nWei et al., 2001). Integrins\r\nare a well-characterized family of receptors that recognize matrix proteins\r\nsuch as collagen, vitronectin, fibulin and fibronectin. Although elastin is\r\nnot a known ligand for integrins, recent work suggests that the integrins may\r\nbe involved in elastin signaling through an intermediary, fibulin 5\r\n(Nakamura et al., 2002;\r\nYanagisawa et al., 2002).\r\nFibulin 5 interacts directly with elastin, and serves as a ligand for\r\ncell-surface integrins. Integrins require extracellular divalent cations to\r\nbind their matrix ligands, and low doses of chelators such as EDTA block these\r\ncell-matrix interactions (Brockdorff et\r\nal., 1998). As expected, control experiments demonstrated that\r\nintegrin mediated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells to collagen was\r\nEDTA sensitive (Fig. 4A).\r\nHowever, EDTA did not interfere with tropoelastin-mediated migration or actin\r\npolymerization of Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 4A,B). In addition,\r\nblocking antibodies to integrins known to bind other matrix proteins such as\r\ncollagen and fibulin 5 did not perturb elastin-mediated actin polymerization\r\nor chemotaxis (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly suggest', ' that the\r\nintegrin family of receptors is not involved in elastin signaling. \r\nView larger version (31K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 4. Tropoelastin regulates migration and actin polymerization via a\r\nnon-integrin, G-protein-coupled signaling pathway. (A)\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to recombinant\r\ntropoelastin in an EDTA insensitive manner. By comparison, we show that\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell migration to collagen, which is mediated by\r\nintegrins, is EDTA sensitive. (B) Tropoelastin mediated actin polymerization\r\nof Eln-/- cells is EDTA insensitive. (C) Migration of\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells towards tropoelastin\r\nis pertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments with the B protomer of\r\npertussis toxin alone demonstrate that the effect of pertussis toxin is\r\nspecific to its ability to inhibit G-protein signaling. The migration of\r\nEln-/- cells to PDGF (30 ng/ml) is insensitive to\r\npertussis toxin. This control experiment demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- cells treated with pertussis toxin can respond\r\nnormally to stimuli other than tropoelastin. (D) Tropoelastin-mediated actin\r\npolymerization of Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells is\r\npertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments demonstrate that the B protomer\r\nof pertussis toxin does not inhibit actin polymerization. Together, these\r\nexperiments indicate that tropoelastin regulates vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nthrough a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein signaling pathway. (E) Cholera\r\ntoxin (ctxn) and forskolin (frskln) increase the baseline levels of cAMP in\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells by constitutive\r\nactivation of the Gs pathway. In the presence of tropoelastin and\r\nforskolin, there is a marked decrease in cAMP. A similar decrease in cAMP\r\nlevels is observed when tropoelastin is added to cholera toxin pretreated\r\ncells. The reduction in cAMP was blocked by', ' pertussis toxin and not B-protomer\r\nindicating a Gi specific pathway. These experiments indicate that\r\ntropoelastin activates a receptor that signals through Gi to\r\ninhibit adenylate cyclase, and reduce cAMP levels. (F) Tropoelastin activates\r\nRhoA in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments\r\ndemonstrate that tropoelastin treatment of Eln-/- cells\r\nresults in a marked elevation of activated RhoA. This response is pertussis\r\ntoxin sensitive and B-protomer insensitive indicating that tropoelastin\r\nactivation of the Rho pathway requires Gi activity. (G) Proposed\r\nmolecular mechanism for tropoelastin-mediated actin polymerization in vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are the largest family of transmembrane\r\nreceptors and are known to activate Rho kinase\r\n(Seasholtz et al., 1999;\r\nMarinissen and Gutkind, 2001).\r\nGPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins classified into four protein\r\nfamilies: Gs, Gi, Gq and G12/13\r\n(Marinissen and Gutkind,\r\n2001). Pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of Gi\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000), blocked\r\ntropoelastin-mediated migration and actin polymerization of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (Fig. 4C,D). The\r\nspecificity of pertussis toxin inhibition was demonstrated in a series of\r\ncontrol experiments. First, migration of vascular smooth muscle cells to\r\nplatelet-derived growth factor is not dependent on a G-protein-coupled\r\nsignaling pathway and was not disrupted by pertussis toxin\r\n(Fig. 4C). Second, pertussis\r\ntoxin is composed of two subunits, A and B\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000). The A\r\nprotomer inhibits Gi by ADP ribosylation, while the B protomer\r\nfacilitates the entry of the toxin into the cell. In the presence of B\r\nprotomer alone, there was no disruption of either migration or actin\r', '\npolymerization (Fig. 4C,D). Using a Ca2+-sensitive dye, fura-2, and immunoprecipitations with\r\nspecific antibodies, we detected no evidence that rapid Ca2+\r\ninflux, tyrosine kinase receptors or the Map kinase pathway was involved in\r\nelastin signaling (data not shown). Together, these experiments indicate that\r\nelastin signaling is mediated via a non-integrin and pertussis toxin-sensitive\r\nG-protein-coupled signaling pathway. \r\nThe pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, Gi, inhibits adenylate\r\ncyclase, the enzyme responsible for generating cAMP\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000). To\r\nobtain direct biochemical evidence that tropoelastin signals through\r\nGi, we measured the level of cAMP in tropoelastin-treated cells. To\r\nmeasure a reduction in cAMP level, it was necessary to increase the baseline\r\ncellular levels of cAMP using either forskolin or cholera toxin, agents that\r\nactivate adenylate cyclase (Thomas et al.,\r\n2000; Coward et al.,\r\n1999). When tropoelastin was added to either forskolin or cholera\r\ntoxin pretreated cells, the reduction in cAMP levels was between 40 and 60%,\r\nindicating that Gi was activated and inhibited adenylate cyclase\r\nactivity (Fig. 4E). These\r\nreductions in cAMP levels are comparable with those observed with other\r\nligands known to activate Gi via known G-protein-coupled receptors\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000;\r\nCoward et al., 1999). The\r\nreduction in cAMP was pertussis toxin sensitive, which confirmed the role of\r\nGi. Thus, tropoelastin activates Gi and reduces cAMP\r\nlevels. Finally, consistent with the activation of Gi, we found no evidence\r\nfor rapid Ca2+ influx, a prominent feature of Gq\r\nactivation, in our cellular system. Although GPCRs activate the Gi\r\npathway and ligands for many of these receptors have not been identified, our\r\ndata does not rule out the possibility that elastin might indirectly activate\r\nthe GPCR pathway at the level of the heterotrimeric G', ' proteins. \r\nOthers have shown that the GPCRs pathway can trigger the Rho signaling\r\ncascade (Seasholtz et al.,\r\n1999; Wei et al.,\r\n2001; Kabarowski et al.,\r\n2000). In this cascade, activated RhoA stimulates Rho kinase. We\r\nexamined whether tropoelastin stimulated the RhoA signaling pathway via\r\nactivation of a G-protein-coupled signaling pathway. Immunoprecipitation\r\nexperiments demonstrate that tropoelastin activates RhoA through a pertussis\r\ntoxin-sensitive mechanism (Fig.\r\n4F). Together, our pharmacological and biochemical data lead us to\r\npropose a molecular mechanism for elastin signaling\r\n(Fig. 4G). In vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells, elastin activates a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein-coupled\r\npathway that stimulates Gi, inhibits adenylate cyclase, reduces\r\ncAMP levels and stimulates Rho induced actin polymerization. In the absence of\r\nelastin synthesis, this mechanism is disrupted and vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells lose their contractile phenotype. Thus, there is a direct role for\r\nelastin in controlling vascular smooth muscle cells. \r\nElastin reduces the vascular proliferative response to arterial\r\ninjury in vivo\r\nThe in vitro experiments described above demonstrated that elastin is an\r\nautocrine factor that induces a contractile state, inhibits proliferation and\r\nlocalizes vascular smooth muscle cells to the vessel wall. These data suggest\r\nthat disruption of a crucial morphogenic signal in the vessel wall may release\r\nsmooth muscle cells to dedifferentiate, proliferate and occlude mature\r\narteries. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we used a porcine model to\r\ndetermine whether the application of exogenous elastin to a site of vascular\r\ninjury would reduce the neointimal accumulation of smooth muscle cells and\r\narterial stenosis. \r\nPorous sheaths of elastin matrix were generated from porcine carotid\r\narteries using established methods (Malone\r\net al., 1984). The purity of the elastin was confirmed by scanning\r\nelectron microscopy (Fig. 5A),\r\nimmunohistochemistry,', ' amino acid composition and desmosine content\r\n(Starcher, 1977) (data not\r\nshown). The amino acid composition and the concentration of the crosslinking\r\namino acids desmosine, isodesmosine and lysinonorleucine revealed no\r\nmicrofibrillar proteins or other impurities. Elastin sheaths were secured to\r\nintracoronary stents (Fig. 5B)\r\nand successfully deployed in porcine coronary arteries using standard\r\ncatheterization techniques. The biocompatibility of elastin sheaths was\r\nassessed 3 days and 14 days after placement in the porcine coronary artery.\r\nElastin sheaths did not evoke an inflammatory or thrombotic response (data not\r\nshown). Moreover, elastin sheaths were biologically stable and did not degrade\r\nwithin the arterial wall during the course of animal studies. These\r\nexperiments demonstrate that elastin sheaths can be used to restore elastin\r\nmatrix to sites of vascular injury. \r\nView larger version (80K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 5. Elastin therapy reduces vascular smooth muscle cell accumulation and\r\narterial obstruction in vivo. (A) Scanning electron micrographs of elastin\r\nsheaths. Scale bar: 10 µm. (B) Elastin matrix sheath covering an expanded\r\nmetal stent. (C,D) Representative cross-sections taken from control arteries\r\n(n=14) display the development of a thick fibrocellular neointima\r\n(C), whereas the neointima is substantially decreased in elastin sheath\r\n(arrows) treated arteries (n=13) with the same injury score (D).\r\n(E,F) Over a range of injury, the percent lumen stenosis (E) and mean\r\nneointimal thickness (F) were significantly reduced (both\r\nP<0.0001) in injured porcine coronary arteries treated with\r\nelastin sheath-stents compared with control stents.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo determine if elastin sheaths would reduce vascular smooth muscle\r\naccumulation and neointimal formation, we used an established porcine coronary\r\ninjury model of', ' in-stent restenosis\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1992;\r\nSchwartz et al., 1994). Two\r\nmajor coronary arteries of domestic pigs received either a control stent or an\r\nelastin sheath-covered stent following vascular injury caused by balloon\r\noverexpansion. Four weeks after injury and stent placement, representative\r\ncross-sections taken from control arteries displayed a thick fibrocellular\r\nneointima (Fig. 5C). By\r\ncontrast, neointimal formation was substantially reduced in elastin\r\nsheath-treated arteries (Fig.\r\n5D). Standard measurements of mean neointimal thickness (NIT) and\r\npercent stenosis were measured and correlated with the degree of injury\r\ninduced by stent placement. The well-established correlation between the\r\nseverity of injury and the amount of neointimal accumulation\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1994) is\r\nreproduced in our experiments with the control stents. Throughout the range of\r\ninjury scores, there is a significant reduction in the NIT and percent\r\nstenosis in elastin sheath-treated arteries, with the greatest benefit at the\r\nhighest injury scores (Fig.\r\n5E,F). At a mean injury score of 2, when stent placement disrupts\r\ninternal elastic lamella and lacerates the arterial media, elastin sheaths\r\nreduced the mean neointimal thickness by 52% as compared with controls. The\r\nspecificity of the effect of elastin as a stent coating is supported by the\r\nwork of our group and others with non-elastin sheaths. Sheaths made from\r\ncollagen, fibrin or synthetic biopolymers failed to reduce neointimal\r\nthickness compared with bare stents and were frequently associated with a\r\nworse outcome (Goodwin et al.,\r\n2000; McKenna et al.,\r\n1998; van der Giessen et al.,\r\n1996; van Beusekom et al.,\r\n1998). Thus, consistent with the in vitro results, our in vivo\r\nexperiments indicate that restoration of elastin matrix to a site of injury\r\nreduces vascular smooth muscle accumulation and limits neointimal\r\nformation. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTOP', '\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nElastin is a critical regulatory molecule within the arterial\r\nwall\r\nWe conclude that elastin is a critical regulatory molecule that controls\r\nthe phenotypic modulation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells. This conclusion is based on the following observations. First,\r\ncells that lack elastin proliferate at a rate twofold greater than wild-type\r\ncells. Second, cells that lack elastin fail to form a mature contractile\r\nphenotype, which is characteristic of wild-type cells. Third, cells that lack\r\nelastin migrate more aggressively to an exogenous chemoattractant than\r\nwild-type cells. Fourth, all of these aberrant phenotypes induced by the\r\nabsence of elastin can be rescued in vitro by the addition of recombinant\r\ntropoelastin. Fifth, elastin exerts its regulatory function on vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells by activating a G-protein coupled signaling pathway. Finally,\r\nrestoring elastin to a site of vascular injury in vivo reduces the neointimal\r\naccumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, elastin matrix deposited\r\nby vascular smooth muscle cells in the arterial media provides a local cue\r\nthat regulates these cells in vitro and in vivo. \r\nElastin-VSMC signaling is a critical morphogenic signal that is\r\ndisrupted during the pathogenesis of vascular disease\r\nVascular smooth muscle cells are able to exist in a quiescent contractile\r\nstate or a proliferative non-contractile state\r\n(Raines and Ross, 1993;\r\nOwens, 1998). This plasticity\r\nenables the vascular system to regenerate and grow. However, plasticity must\r\nbe balanced by the need to maintain a mature and stable structure capable of\r\ncirculating blood throughout a whole animal. Because vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells modulate their phenotype readily, external factors must instruct them to\r\nremain in a mature state if homeostasis is to be achieved. Our data indicate\r\nthat the elastin matrix is a potent autocrine factor that regulates arterial\r\nmorphogenesis by instructing vascular smooth muscle cells to', ' localize around\r\nthe elastic fibers in organized rings and remain in a quiescent, contractile\r\nstate (Fig. 6A). This\r\ncell-matrix interaction is mediated via a heterotrimeric G-protein signaling\r\npathway that activates downstream rho GTPases and appears to be crucial for\r\nstabilizing and maintaining the structure of the mature artery. When this\r\nmorphogenic signal is absent during arterial development, the unregulated\r\nmigration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells results in\r\nocclusion of the arterial lumen (Li et\r\nal., 1998) (Fig.\r\n6B). This leads us to propose that focal disruption or destruction\r\nof the elastin matrix in the mature artery by factors such as mechanical\r\ninjury or inflammation play an important and direct role in the fibrocellular\r\nresponse characteristic of proliferative vascular diseases\r\n(Fig. 6C). Previously, emphasis\r\nwas placed on the pivotal role of inflammatory cells in regulating vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors\r\n(Lusis, 2000;\r\nRoss, 1995). In our model, the\r\ndegradation of elastin by macrophages, T-cells and their proteases acts to\r\nrelease vascular smooth muscle cells from their mature contractile state to\r\nmigrate, proliferate and form a neointima. Thus, the disruption of an\r\nessential morphogenic signal contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular\r\ndisease. \r\nView larger version (37K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 6. Model of elastin-vascular smooth muscle cell interactions in development\r\nand disease. (A) During normal development, vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nsynthesize and secrete elastin polymers that form concentric rings of elastic\r\nlamellae around the arterial lumen. Elastin provides mechanical support to the\r\nvessel wall, and signals vascular smooth muscle cells to localize around the\r\nelastic lamellae and remain in a quiescent, contractile state. (B) In the\r\nabsence of elastin, this morphogenic signal is lost resulting in pervasive\r\nsubendothelial migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nthat occludes the', ' vascular lumen. (C) This leads us to propose that the focal\r\ndisruption and/or destruction of elastin in the mature artery by vascular\r\ninjury releases smooth muscle cells to dedifferentiate, migrate and\r\nproliferate, and contributes to neointimal formation.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nFour lines of evidence support our model of elastin-vascular smooth muscle\r\nsignaling in the pathogenesis of vascular proliferative diseases. \r\nPathology\r\nDisruption of elastin matrix is consistently associated with vascular\r\nproliferative diseases in human pathological specimens\r\n(Sandberg et al., 1981;\r\nSims, 2000;\r\nSims et al., 1989). Moreover,\r\nthe severity of occlusive vascular pathology increases in proportion to the\r\nmagnitude of defects and discontinuities in the elastin matrix\r\n(Sims et al., 1989). It has\r\nalso been noted that the programmed intimal hyperplasia and arterial occlusion\r\nrequired for the closure of the ductus arteriosis is associated with impaired\r\nelastic fiber formation (Hinek et al.,\r\n1991). \r\nGenetic\r\nWe previously showed in human genetic studies that loss-of-function\r\nmutations in elastin is sufficient to cause a human vascular proliferative\r\ndisease, supravalvular aortic stenosis and Williams-Beuren syndrome\r\n(Li et al., 1997;\r\nCurran et al., 1993; Ewart,\r\n1993). In these diseases, there is an aggressive occlusive pathology that\r\ndevelops throughout the arterial tree of affected children in the absence of\r\ncommon risk factors for vascular disease. \r\nExperimental\r\nIn murine gene-targeting experiments, we demonstrated that loss of elastin\r\nis sufficient to cause occlusive vascular pathology\r\n(Li et al., 1998). This\r\npathology was caused by the unregulated proliferation, migration and\r\naccumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the subendothelial space\r\n(Fig. 6B). In this model,\r\nsevere arterial obstruction occurs in the absence of an inflammatory response\r\nor hemodynamic stress. \r\nTherapeutic\r\nIn this manuscript, we show that exogenous tropoelastin can control the\r\nprol', 'iferation, migration and maturation of vascular smooth muscle cells in\r\nvitro, and reduce the development of fibrocellular pathology in vivo. Other\r\ninvestigators have shown that matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, which\r\nprevent the degradation of matrix components, can reduce neointimal formation\r\n(Zaidi et al., 2000).\r\nTogether, these data indicate that the destruction of the elastin matrix is a\r\ncritical step in the fibrocellular response characteristic of vascular\r\nproliferative disorders. Although strongly indicative, definitive proof of a\r\nrole for elastin signaling in a vascular proliferative response requires\r\nfurther studies. \r\nElastin is unique among vascular extracellular matrix proteins\r\nThe extracellular matrix is known to play a crucial function in the\r\nregulation of vascular smooth muscle cell biology. The myriad associations and\r\ninteraction between the many structural proteins, proteoglycans and growth\r\nfactors of the vascular matrix makes it difficult to distinguish the effects\r\nof each element from one another. However, numerous in vitro studies have\r\ndemonstrated the ability of matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin and\r\nlaminin to affect vascular smooth muscle cell activity, including phenotypic\r\nmodulation, migration and proliferation\r\n(Raines, 2000;\r\nHedin et al., 1999). These\r\ndata might suggest that there is overlap and redundancy with regard to the\r\nfunction of different vascular matrix proteins. Elastin, however, is unique\r\namong matrix elements in that the disruption of this gene leads to a vascular\r\nproliferative pathology in human and animal models. Disruption of other genes\r\nencoding vascular matrix proteins, including fibulin, fibrillin and collagen\r\nis associated with either arterial tortuosity, dissection or aneurysm\r\nformation in vivo, not proliferative or occlusive vascular pathology\r\n(Nakamura et al., 2002;\r\nYanagisawa et al., 2002;\r\nArteaga-Solis et al., 2000;\r\nDietz and Mecham, 2000).\r\nMoreover, the specificity of the effect of elastin in vivo is supported by\r\nstudies showing that collagen matrix-covered stents do not reduce neointimal\r\nformation in a porcine model of restenosis\r\n', '(Goodwin et al., 2000). Thus,\r\nelastin, when compared with other matrix proteins, is effective in both in\r\nvitro and in vivo experimental models. From these studies one would expect\r\nthat targeted disruption of the elastin signaling mechanism would replicate\r\nphenotypes observed in Eln-/- cell and mice. \r\nRestoration of elastin for the treatment of proliferative vascular\r\ndiseases\r\nOur work suggests that understanding the link between vascular development\r\nand disease may provide an alternative and potentially complementary strategy\r\nfor the treatment of vascular proliferative diseases. Previously, emphasis has\r\nbeen placed on improving the outcome of vascular disease by inhibiting smooth\r\nmuscle cell proliferation with coronary stents coated with either\r\nradioactivity or chemotherapeutic drugs such as rapamycin, actinomycin D and\r\npaclitaxil (Heldman et al.,\r\n2001; Leon et al.,\r\n2001; Sousa et al.,\r\n2001). These treatments use a common strategy of disrupting\r\nfundamental pathways such as microtubule assembly, DNA stability, and\r\nregulatory cell cycle proteins that are required in virtually all actively\r\ndividing cells. We present work that suggests restoring a natural morphogenic\r\nsignal to the vessel wall may also be therapeutically beneficial. Clearly,\r\nadditional work is needed to verify that results with murine and porcine\r\nmodels are recapitulated in humans. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\xa0\r\nWe thank Bob Mecham for assistance with synthesizing recombinant\r\ntropoelastin, confirming the purity of the elastin sheath and recombinant\r\ntropoelastin, providing the polyclonal murine tropoelastin antibody, and\r\ndiscussions; Roy Biran (Keck Center for Tissue Engineering) for antibodies and\r\nhelp with fluorescent imaging; and Mary Scriven for assistance in generating\r\nmanuscript figures.

This fibrocellular response has largely been\r\nattributed to the release of multiple cytokines and growth factors by\r\ninflammatory cells. Previously, we demonstrated that the disruption of the\r\nel', 'astin matrix leads to defective arterial morphogenesis. Here, we propose\r\nthat elastin is a potent autocrine regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nactivity and that this regulation is important for preventing fibrocellular\r\npathology. Using vascular smooth muscle cells from mice lacking elastin\r\n(Eln-/-), we show that elastin induces actin stress fiber\r\norganization, inhibits proliferation, regulates migration and signals via a\r\nnon-integrin, heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled pathway. In a porcine coronary\r\nmodel of restenosis, the therapeutic delivery of exogenous elastin to injured\r\nvessels in vivo significantly reduces neointimal formation. These findings\r\nindicate that elastin stabilizes the arterial structure by inducing a\r\nquiescent contractile state in vascular smooth muscle cells. Together, this\r\nwork demonstrates that signaling pathways crucial for arterial morphogenesis\r\ncan play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of vascular\r\ndisease. \r\nKey words: Elastin matrix, Vascular smooth muscle, Morphogenesis, G-protein signaling, Vascular proliferative diseases\r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nVascular proliferative diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that\r\ninclude atherosclerosis, coronary restenosis, bypass-graft failure and\r\ntransplant arteriopathy that lead to arterial narrowing, restriction of blood\r\nflow and tissue ischemia. These diseases arise from a complex\r\npathophysiological response to injury by multiple factors, including\r\nhypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, hypertension and mechanical injury\r\n(Ross, 1995;\r\nLusis, 2000). Although their\r\netiologies are diverse, these disorders all share a common pathological\r\nfeature: the accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells and fibrous\r\nconnective tissue within the intima between the endothelium and medial layer\r\nof the vessel wall (Lusis,\r\n2000; Raines and Ross,\r\n1993). This fibrocellular pathology, known as neointimal\r\nformation, results from the activation, proliferation and migration', ' of\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (Raines and\r\nRoss, 1993; Schwartz,\r\n1997). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell regulation is crucial for developing strategies to\r\nprevent and treat vascular proliferative disorders. \r\n \r\nVascular smooth muscle cells are not terminally differentiated and can\r\nalternate between a quiescent, contractile state and a proliferative\r\nnon-contractile state (Raines and Ross,\r\n1993; Owens, 1998;\r\nThyberg, 1998). In a healthy\r\nartery, vascular smooth muscle cells are quiescent and largely comprise a\r\ncontractile apparatus that functions to dilate and constrict the lumen as\r\nrequired by physiological demands. Actin stress fibers serve as the scaffold\r\nfor the contractile apparatus, and are a hallmark of mature and quiescent\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (Burridge and\r\nChrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996;\r\nSmall and Gimona, 1998). Under\r\ncircumstances of injury, repair and regeneration, vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nlose their contractile apparatus and dedifferentiate into an immature\r\nphenotype capable of proliferating and depositing extracellular matrix\r\n(Owens, 1998;\r\nThyberg, 1998). This\r\nfibrocellular response plays an important role in all forms of vascular\r\nproliferative diseases. In atherosclerotic lesions, the major components of\r\nthe fibrous plaque are vascular smooth muscle cells, the matrix products\r\ndeposited by these cells, and extracellular cholesterol\r\n(Ross, 1995;\r\nLusis, 2000;\r\nRaines and Ross, 1993). In\r\nrestenosis, transplant arteriopathy and vascular graft disease; smooth muscle\r\ncells are the predominant component of the occlusive lesion\r\n(Raines and Ross, 1993). The\r\nphenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells offers a tempting target\r\nfor preventing vascular proliferative diseases. \r\nElastin is the dominant extracellular matrix protein deposited in the\r\narterial wall and can contribute up to 50% of its dry weight\r\n(Parks et al., 1993). The\r\nprotein product of the elastin gene is synthesized by vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells', ' and secreted as a monomer, tropoelastin. After post-translational\r\nmodification, tropoelastin is crosslinked and organized into elastin polymers\r\nthat form concentric rings of elastic lamellae around the arterial lumen. Each\r\nelastic lamella alternates with a ring of smooth muscle, and provides the\r\ncompliance that arteries need to absorb and transmit hemodynamic force\r\n(Wolinski et al., 1967). There\r\nis a growing body of evidence that implicates elastin in vascular development\r\nand disease. We previously demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations of one\r\nelastin allele cause supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and Williams-Beuren\r\nSyndrome (Li et al., 1997;\r\nCurran et al., 1993;\r\nEwart et al., 1993). These\r\ndisorders are characterized by discrete fibrocellular stenoses in the aorta,\r\ncoronary arteries, carotid arteries, pulmonary arteries and other peripheral\r\narteries. Often, individuals with these diseases are young children who are\r\nsusceptible to peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarctions or stroke\r\nin the absence of other risk factors such as high serum cholesterol, diabetes\r\nand cigarette smoking (van Son et al.,\r\n1994). In subsequent experiments, we showed that the deposition of\r\nelastin matrix in the arterial wall during late fetal development is essential\r\nto arterial morphogenesis (Li et al.,\r\n1998). Mice that lack elastin (Eln-/-) died\r\nfrom occlusive fibrocellular pathology caused by subendothelial proliferation\r\nand accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in early neonatal life. In\r\nEln-/- vessels, there is no evidence of abnormal\r\nendothelial structure, activation or proliferation. Furthermore, the occlusive\r\nvascular phenotype occurred in the absence of hemodynamic stress and\r\ninflammation. This work demonstrated that elastin is required for arterial\r\ndevelopment. However, because the absence of elastin undoubtedly distorts the\r\npresentation and stability of other important elements of the matrix\r\narchitecture, these studies failed to define the specific role for elastin in\r\nestablishing and maintaining a mature artery. \r', ""\nHere we show that elastin regulates the phenotypic modulation,\r\nproliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. We\r\nconfirm a direct signaling effect by demonstrating that elastin regulates\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells via a G-protein-coupled signaling pathway.\r\nFinally, we establish that in vivo, exogenous elastin reduces the vascular\r\nproliferative response of an injured artery. These results demonstrate that\r\nelastin is a crucial signaling molecule that directly controls vascular smooth\r\nmuscle biology and stabilizes arterial structure. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nIsolation of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nNewborn (postnatal day 0.5) Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- pups were sacrificed by CO2\r\nasphyxiation. Their ascending aortas were dissected free, endothelium removed\r\nand placed into individual wells of a plastic 12-well culture dish containing\r\nAmniomax C-100 growth medium (Gibco-BRL) supplemented with\r\npenicillin/streptomycin. Cultures of smooth muscle cells that formed around\r\nthe tissue were trypsinized (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA), passaged, expanded\r\nand genotyped to confirm their identity. Cells were stained with SM\r\n-actin (Clone 1A4, Sigma) and checked for classic `hill-and-valley'\r\nmorphology to confirm their smooth muscle status. In situ hybridization,\r\nimmunostaining and RT/PCR analysis established that these cells expressed the\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell markers SM -actin, SM -actin, SM-22,\r\ncalponin, desmin, ang-1/ang-2, and did not express the endothelial markers\r\nFlk-1 or Flt-1. \r\nCellular assays\r\nCellular experiments of proliferation, actin polymerization and migration\r\ndescribed below were performed on at least three independently isolated\r\nprimary cell lines. Proliferation was assayed by"", ' cell count and\r\n[3H]thymidine incorporation. Confluent cultures of\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells from the fourth passage were seeded at a density of\r\n2x103 cells/well on a plastic 24-well plate (Corning Costar,\r\nCorning, NY), and stimulated to proliferate in AmnioMAX C-100 growth medium\r\n(Gibco-BRL) treated with 100 µg/ml recombinant tropoelastin or left\r\nuntreated. Cell numbers for each culture were assayed by hemocytometer after\r\n24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. For [3H]thymidine incorporation,\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- cells were seeded at\r\na density of 20,000 cells/well on a 24-well plate. After attachment, cells\r\nwere starved in 0.1% BSA (Fisher) in Amniomax Basal Medium (Gibco) for 24\r\nhours. Cells were then grown in whole Amniomax medium treated/untreated with\r\n100 µg/ml tropoelastin (Grosso et al., 1991a). Cells were assayed for\r\n[3H]thymidine incorporation using a scintillation counter after 24\r\nhours by precipitating with 5% TCA, followed by NaOH solubilization. Data were\r\ncalculated as mean±s.d. (n=6). \r\nSubconfluent cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells were evaluated and\r\nscored for the presence of actin stress fibers in the cytoplasm following\r\nimmunofluorescent staining for SM -actin (Clone 1A4, Sigma), vinculin\r\n(Clone hVin-1, Sigma), desmin (Sigma) and tubulin (Clone DM-1A, Calbiochem).\r\nCells were treated with tropoelastin (1 µg/ml) (Grosso et al., 1991a) or\r\nnot, and assays were performed in serum-free media. Cells were scored as\r\ncontractile if they had distinct actin stress fibers continuous throughout the\r\ncytoplasm, or at least 10 well-defined focal adhesions distributed throughout\r\nthe cytoplasm and cell', ' periphery. Scoring was performed by three separate\r\nobservers blinded to the cell genotypes, and their numbers averaged. At least\r\n100 cells were scored in three separate cultures for each genotype.\r\nAdditionally, identical results were obtained for cells cultured on glass\r\nslides, 24 plastic tissue culture plates (Corning) coated with matrigel, and\r\nanother brand of plasticware (Falcon). \r\nThe chemotactic activity of cells was assayed in a modification of the\r\nBoyden chamber method using 6.5 mm transwell polycarbonate chemotaxis filter\r\ninserts in a plastic 24-well tissue culture plate (Corning Costar, Corning,\r\nNY). Various concentrations of recombinant tropoelastin (Grosso et al., 1991a)\r\nwere placed in both the upper or lower compartment and covered with a\r\npolycarbonate membrane filter (8 µm porosity). PDGF-BB (30 ng/ml) was added\r\nto the lower chamber and served as a positive control. Medium alone was used\r\nas the negative control. Cells to be tested were placed in the upper wells of\r\nthe chamber and incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 3 hours. After\r\nincubation, the cells adhering to the upper surface of the filter were scraped\r\noff and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface were fixed with 10%\r\nbuffered formalin, stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and viewed\r\nunder a mercury lamp. Fifteen randomly selected high power (x200) fields\r\nwere counted on each filter by observers blinded to their conditions.\r\nChemotactic response was measured as the number of cells that had transversed\r\nthe filter in response to tropoelastin, PDGF and collagen type I (10\r\nµg/ml), and expressed as fold increase over baseline. Each condition was\r\nassayed in triplicate wells and each experiment was repeated at least three\r\ntimes. Actin polymerization and migration assays experiments were also\r\nperformed in triplicate in the presence of 100 µM Actinomycin D\r\n(Calbiochem), 10 µg/ml Cycloheximide (Calbiochem), 20 µM Y27632\r\n(Welfide), 20 µM ED', 'TA, 100 ng/ml Ptxn (Calbiochem) or 100 ng/ml B-protomer\r\n(Calbiochem). \r\nMeasurement of cAMP and activated Rho A\r\nAll biochemical measurements were performed in cells that were serum\r\nstarved overnight. cAMP assay levels were detected using an RIA kit (RPA538,\r\nAmersham Pharmacia). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 80,000 to\r\n100,000 cells on a plastic 12-well cell-culture plate, pretreated with 100\r\nng/ml cholera toxin (Calbiochem) for 3 hours, treated with 1 µg/ml\r\nrecombinant tropoelastin for 20 minutes, and cAMP subsequently isolated.\r\nExperimental cAMP levels were quantified through use of a standard curve where\r\nknown amounts of cAMP were added to radioimmunoassay. \r\nRhoA-GTP was detected using a Rho Activation Kit (Upstate Biotechnology).\r\nBriefly, Eln-/- cells were grown to 70% confluence in a\r\nsix-well plate, and pretreated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin or 100 ng/ml\r\nB-protomer for 3 hours. Control experiments with no pretreatment were also\r\nperformed. Cells were then treated with 1 µg/ml recombinant tropoelastin\r\nfor 3 hours and activated Rho A was isolated by immunoprecipitations with\r\nRhotekin coated beads. RhoA-GTP was detected by western blot analysis after\r\nsamples were run on a 10% acryllamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose\r\nmembranes. Equal amounts of total cellular lysate were run out for each sample\r\nto ensure that equivalent amounts of protein were used in all experiments. \r\nPorcine coronary model of in-stent restenosis\r\nElastin sheaths were prepared from dissected common carotid arteries of\r\nadult domestic swine (40 to 60 kg) using a variation of a previously published\r\nprotocol (Malone et al.,\r\n1984). Briefly, these vessels were sequentially treated with a 1%\r\nSDS solution supplemented with doxycycline (10 mg/l) and EDTA (5 mM),', '\r\npotassium hydroxide (5 N) at 60°C, collagenase solution (0.5 mg/ml,\r\nCollagenase D, Roche), autoclaved and  irradiated. The product of these\r\nextractions, a tubular elastin matrix sheath, was cut to size and fitted over\r\n14 mm long stainless steel expandable stents (Medtronic AVE, S670) mounted on\r\n3.5 mm diameter angioplasty balloons and secured by a metal coil. Control\r\nstents deployed were identical to elastin covered stents except for the\r\nabsence of elastin sheaths. \r\nNineteen domestic pigs (30 to 40 kg) on a normal diet were pretreated with\r\noral aspirin (625 mg), ticlopidine (250 mg) and verapamil (120 mg), and placed\r\nunder general anesthesia. Animals underwent placement of 32 stents in the left\r\nanterior descending, circumflex or right coronary artery. The methods of stent\r\nimplantation have been previously described\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1994).\r\nBriefly, control stents or elastin sheath-covered stents were advanced under\r\nfluoroscopic guidance to an appropriate site in the coronary vasculature and\r\ndeployed at a 1.2:1 to 1.4:1 stent-to-artery ratio compared with the baseline\r\nvessel diameter. After the procedure, the wounds were closed and the pigs were\r\nreturned to their quarters on a normal diet. Pigs were sacrificed at day 3\r\n(elastin-covered stent, n=2) and day 14 (elastin-covered stent,\r\nn=2) to assess biocompatibility of the elastin sheath. To study\r\nneointima formation, pigs were sacrificed at day 28 (control stents,\r\nn=15; elastin-covered stents, n=14) and instrumented\r\narteries were removed. Coronary arteries were fixed by pressure perfusion (100\r\nmm Hg) with 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours, dissected free, washed,\r\ndehydrated through graded alcohols and infiltrated with methylmethacrylate\r\n(MMA) at 4°C. After polymerization,', ' embedded specimens were\r\ncross-sectioned at 5 µm thickness using a tungsten-carbide microtome blade.\r\nEach arterial segment was stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and elastic Van\r\nGieson stains. Three cross-sections taken from the two ends and the middle of\r\neach artery were used for histomorphometric analysis. Histological examination\r\nconfirmed that the elastin sheaths were retained in the arterial wall of all\r\nspecimens. \r\nHistomorphometric analysis\r\nMean neointimal thickness, percent stenosis and mean injury score were\r\nmeasured on Van Gieson-stained sections using calibrated digital microscopic\r\nplanimetry as previously described\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1992;\r\nSchwartz et al., 1994).\r\nBriefly, the mean neointimal thickness was measured by drawing a radial line\r\nfrom the lumen border to the point maximum penetration for each stent strut,\r\nand averaging the measurements. Percent area stenosis was calculated as %\r\nstenosis=100 x [1-(stenotic lumen area/original lumen area)]. The\r\noriginal lumen area was measured as the area subtended within the internal\r\nelastic lamina. The injury score measures the physical penetration of the\r\nstent strut into the vessel wall and was calculated using a graded scale from\r\n0-3 as previously described (Schwartz et\r\nal., 1992). Briefly, a score of 1 indicated that only the internal\r\nelastic lamina was lacerated; a score of 2 indicated laceration of the\r\narterial media; and a score of 3 indicated that the external elastic lamina\r\nwas lacerated. The mean injury score for each histological section was\r\ncalculated as mean injury score= injury scores for every strut/number\r\nof struts present per section. \r\nStatistics\r\nFor all in vitro experiments, mean and standard deviations were calculated\r\nand statistical analysis were carried out by analysis of variance (ANOVA). For\r\nin vivo experiments, statistical analysis was performed on injury score,\r\naverage neointimal thickness and percent lumen stenosis using regression\r\nmodeling (Schwartz et al.,\r\n1994). Linear regression modeling accounts for injury (a strong\r\ncovariate) and the injury-dependent ne', 'ointimal thickening between control\r\narteries and elastin treated arteries. Three models were used to establish\r\nwhether there were: (1) differences in intercepts, (2) differences in slopes\r\nallowing any intercept or (3) differences in slopes when the intercepts are\r\nfixed. Differences between the elastin sheath-stent and control stent at each\r\ninjury level were analyzed using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons\r\nt test for all three regression models. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nRESULTS\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nElastin inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells\r\nInvestigating the role of elastin in regulating vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells is confounded by the fact that these cells synthesize and secrete\r\nelastin. Thus, to determine the role of elastin in regulating cellular\r\nproliferation, differentiation and migration, we isolated vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells from mice lacking elastin (Eln-/-) and from\r\nwild-type sibling control animals (Eln+/+).\r\nImmunofluorescent staining and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction\r\n(RT-PCR) analyses established that Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells expressed and synthesized elastin (antibody to murine elastin\r\nkindly provided by Dr Robert Mecham, Washington University), whereas\r\nEln-/- cells did not\r\n(Fig. 1A-C). \r\nView larger version (64K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 1. Elastin inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. (A) RT-PCR\r\nexperiments confirm that murine vascular smooth muscle cells lines express\r\ncell specific markers. The elastin gene product is detected in\r\nEln+/+ and not Eln-/- cells.\r\nImmunofluorescence analysis with elastin antibodies and accompanying phase\r\nphotomicrographs demonstrate that Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (B) synthesize and secrete elastin matrix, whereas\r\nEln', '-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (C) do not produce\r\nelastin. (D) Assay measuring cell numbers demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate at a much\r\nhigher rate than do Eln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(P<0.0001, ANOVA). This difference is eliminated by the addition\r\nof recombinant elastin gene product or tropoelastin (tEln). (E) Assay\r\nmeasuring [3H]thymidine incorporation assay demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate at a rate\r\nover twofold greater than that for Eln+/+ cells. This\r\ndifference is eliminated by the inhibition of Eln-/- cells\r\nproliferation by tropoelastin (P<0.0001, ANOVA).\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo evaluate the role of elastin in vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nproliferation, we compared the growth rate of Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells. Cells were seeded at the same density and\r\ngrowth rates were assayed by counting cells after 24, 48 and 72 hours. The\r\nnumber of Eln-/- cells was greater than\r\nEln+/+ cells at all time points, and was increased over\r\ntwofold at 72 hours (Fig. 1D).\r\nThese data indicate that in the absence of elastin synthesis, vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells proliferate at an increased rate. \r\nTo prove the specificity of the effect of elastin on vascular smooth muscle\r\ncell growth, we tested whether adding exogenous recombinant tropoelastin to\r\nthe culture media inhibits cellular proliferation. Recombinant tropoelastin\r\nwas synthesized using a bacterial expression system (Grosso et al., 1991a) and\r\ndetermined to be pure by gel electrophoresis and amino acid composition.\r\nTropoelastin had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation, with a\r\nmaximal effect at 100 µg/ml (Fig.\r\n1D; data not shown). At this dose, the number of\r\nEln-/- cells was nearly identical to\r\nEln+/+ cells at 72 hours. At each time point, more than\r\n98% of all cells were viable as determined by Try', 'pan Blue staining, indicating\r\nthat tropoelastin was not cytotoxic. Similar results were observed when acid\r\nhydrolyzed elastic fibers,  elastin, were used for this assay. The\r\nresponses of Eln+/+ and Eln-/-\r\ncellular proliferation to tropoelastin\r\n(Fig. 1E) and  elastin\r\n(data not shown) were reproduced in [3H]thymidine incorporation\r\nassays. By comparison, there was no significant inhibitory effect on\r\nproliferation when Eln-/- cells were treated with type I\r\ncollagen (100 µg/ml) (data not shown). These data demonstrate that elastin\r\nregulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. \r\nElastin induces a mature contractile phenotype in vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells\r\nThe primary function of mature differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nis contraction. This ability requires highly organized actin myofilaments,\r\noften referred to as actin stress fibers\r\n(Burridge et al., 1996;\r\nSmall and Gimona, 1998). To\r\ndetermine if elastin modulates the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells,\r\nwe evaluated actin organization in Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells using direct immunofluorescent staining with\r\nFITC-conjugated SM -actin antisera. Well-defined actin myofilaments\r\nwere apparent in more than 95% of Eln+/+ cells scored by\r\nobservers blinded to genotype (Fig.\r\n2A,E). By contrast, only 23% of Eln-/- cells\r\nhad actin stress fibers (Fig.\r\n2B,E). Furthermore, Eln-/- cells with actin\r\nstress fibers were qualitatively different than Eln+/+\r\ncells, with a distinctive, rounder morphology (data not shown). These data\r\nindicate that vascular smooth muscle cells lacking elastin fail to organize\r\ntheir contractile apparatus. \r\nView larger version (57K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 2. Elastin induces a mature contractile phenotype in vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells. (A-E) Immunofluorescence analysis for SM -', 'actin reveals that\r\nEln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells (A) have a highly\r\norganized network of actin stress fibers, a hallmark of mature contractile\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells. By contrast, there is a paucity of actin stress\r\nfibers in Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (B; outlined\r\nby white dots). The elastin gene product, recombinant tropoelastin, induces\r\nthe formation of organized actin stress fibers in Eln-/-\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (D), but does not affect\r\nEln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells (C). Scoring analysis\r\ndemonstrates a significant increase in the percentage of\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells with organized actin\r\nmyofilaments after elastin treatment (P<0.0001) (E). Tropoelastin\r\nmediated actin polymerization is unaffected when Eln-/-\r\ncells are treated with either a gene transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D,\r\nor a protein translation inhibitor, cycloheximide. The Rho kinase inhibitor,\r\nY27632, blocks actin polymerization of tropoelastin treated\r\nEln-/- cells. (F-J) Immunofluorescence analysis for\r\nvinculin reveals that Eln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(F) have well-defined focal adhesions (arrowheads). By contrast,\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (G; outlined by white\r\ndots) have poorly defined focal adhesions. Tropoelastin induces well-defined\r\nfocal adhesions (arrows) throughout Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (I), but does not affect Eln+/+ vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells (H). Scoring analysis revealed a significant increase\r\n(P<0.0001) in the percentage of Eln-/-\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells with defined focal adhesions after tropoelastin\r\ntreatment (J). (K,L) Immunofluorescence staining with antisera against tubulin\r\nreveals no difference between Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (K) and Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(L). Exposure times for all images are the same.', ' Results represent the\r\nmean±s.d. from three individual experiments.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo confirm that the failure to form an organized contractile apparatus in\r\nEln-/- cells resulted from the inability to synthesize and\r\nsecrete elastin, we treated these cells with recombinant tropoelastin protein.\r\nWithin 3 hours of exposure to tropoelastin, the percentage of\r\nEln-/- cells with organized actin stress fibers increased\r\nthreefold to 74% (Fig. 2D,E).\r\nThis response was does dependent and was also seen by phallodin staining for\r\nF-actin (data not shown). By comparison, tropoelastin treatment had not effect\r\non actin stress fiber organization in Eln+/+ cells\r\n(Fig. 2C,E). Similar results\r\nwere observed when Eln-/- cells were treated with\r\ncrosslinked  elastin (data not shown). However, no change in actin\r\nstress fiber organization was observed when Eln-/- cells\r\nwere treated with an equivalent concentration of type I collagen. In addition,\r\nthe induction of actin polymerization by tropoelastin was unaffected by the\r\npresence or absence of serum in culture (data not shown). Thus, extracellular\r\nelastin is an important mediator of actin polymerization and contractile\r\napparatus organization in vascular smooth muscle cells. \r\nThe Rho signal transduction pathway is known to be a central converging\r\nstep in the formation of actin stress fibers through a post-translational\r\nmechanism (Mack et al., 2001;\r\nBishop and Hall, 2000). We\r\ninvestigated the role of this pathway in the regulation by tropoelastin of\r\nactin polymerization. The addition of actinomycin D\r\n(Greenburg et al., 1986), an\r\ninhibitor of gene transcription, or cycloheximide\r\n(Greenburg et al., 1986), an\r\ninhibitor of protein translation, did not block tropoelastin-induced actin\r\npolymerization in Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 2E). Furthermore, a\r\nspecific inhibitor of the Rho signaling pathway that targets Rho kinase,\r\nY276', '32 (Mack et al., 2001;\r\nUshata et al., 1997), blocked\r\ntropoelastin mediated actin polymerization of Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 2E). Additionally,\r\ntropoelastin treatment of Eln-/- vsmc did not alter the\r\namount of SM  actin transcript or protein levels as quantified by\r\nnorthern and western blot analysis but did shift the filamentous:globular\r\n(F:G) actin ratio from 1:1 to 3.1:1 (data not shown). These experiments, in\r\ncombination with the failure of either transcription or translation inhibitors\r\nto inhibit tropoelastin-induced actin stress fiber formation in\r\nEln-/- vsmc, suggest that elastin modulates vsmc phenotype\r\nby regulating actin treadmilling via a signal transduction pathway involving\r\nRho GTPases and their effector proteins. \r\nTo evaluate further the effect of elastin on the contractile phenotype in\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells, we examined the organization of vinculin,\r\ntubulin and desmin in Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells (Burridge\r\net al., 1996). Vinculin is concentrated in focal adhesion plaques\r\nthat bind the actin cytoskeleton and connect with the cell membrane. Indirect\r\nimmunofluorescent staining for vinculin revealed abundant focal adhesion\r\nplaques in 94% of Eln+/+ cells when scored by observers\r\nblinded to genotype (Fig.\r\n2F,J). By contrast, only 12% of Eln-/- cells\r\nhad a normal distribution of defined focal adhesion plaques\r\n(Fig. 2G,J). Within 3 hours of\r\nexposure to recombinant tropoelastin protein, the percentage of\r\nEln-/- cells with defined focal adhesions increased 6-fold\r\nto 79% (Fig. 2I,J). Treatment\r\nhad no effect on focal adhesion organization in Eln+/+\r\ncells (Fig. 2H,J).\r\nImmunostaining for other cytoskeletal proteins, tubulin\r\n(Fig. 2K,L) and desmin (data\r\nnot shown) showed no difference between Eln+/+', ' and\r\nEln-/- cells. Thus, the loss of elastin in vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells does not lead to a broad disruption of cytoskeletal architecture.\r\nThese results indicate that elastin induces a mature, contractile phenotype in\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells by regulating the organization of specific\r\ncytoskeletal proteins. \r\nElastin controls the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nVascular proliferative disease involves the migration of smooth muscle\r\ncells from the arterial media to the subendothelial space, forming a neointima\r\n(Schwartz, 1997). The same\r\nphenomenon is observed during the development of Eln-/-\r\narteries. We postulated that the elastin matrix surrounding each concentric\r\nlayer of vascular smooth muscle cells provides a cue that localizes these\r\ncells to the arterial media, and prevents their migration to the neointima. To\r\ntest this hypothesis, we used a modified Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay. We\r\ndiscovered that vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to tropoelastin in a\r\ndose-dependent manner (Fig.\r\n3A). Cell migration depended on the concentration gradient of\r\ntropoelastin, not the total amount used in the assay. Chemotaxis was minimal\r\nfor cells in control (0/0 ng/ml) and static fields of tropoelastin (200/200\r\nng/ml), but increased significantly as the concentration gradient of\r\ntropoelastin rose to 200 ng/ml. A similar but less dramatic effect was seen\r\nwith cells that produce elastin (Fig.\r\n3A), suggesting that the synthesis and secretion of elastin by\r\nEln+/+ cells reduced migration to external stimuli. These\r\ndata demonstrate that elastin is a potent chemoattractant for vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells. \r\nView larger version (18K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 3. Elastin controls migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. (A)\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells migrate to tropoelastin in a concentration-dependent manner,\r\nindicating that tropoelastin is a specific and direct stimulus for vascular', '\r\nsmooth muscle cell localization. In addition, Eln-/- cells\r\nconsistently migrated at a higher rate than Eln+/+ cells,\r\nsuggesting that the autocrine production of elastin by\r\nEln+/+ cells reduces their chemotaxis to external stimuli.\r\n(B) Tropoelastin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell migration to the\r\nchemotactic growth factor PDGF. A modified Boyden chamber assay was used for\r\nall experiments to determine the total number of migrated cells in 15 randomly\r\nselected high power microscope fields (HPF). Data shown are the\r\nmean±s.e.m. from three independent wells.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nCytokines and growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor\r\n(PDGF), are thought to mediate the subendothelial migration of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells in occlusive vascular lesions\r\n(Lusis, 2000;\r\nBornfeldt et al., 1993). To\r\ndetermine if elastin matrix deposited in the arterial media can counteract the\r\npotent chemotactic activity of PDGF, we repeated the Boyden chamber\r\nexperiments. At a PDGF concentration of 30 ng/ml, Eln-/-\r\ncells showed a fourfold increase in chemotactic activity\r\n(Fig. 3B). Increasing\r\nconcentrations of tropoelastin prevented Eln-/- cell\r\nmigration towards PDGF (Fig.\r\n3B). Similar results were observed in Eln+/+\r\ncells. These data suggest that elastin provides a local cue that prevents\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells from migrating away from the arterial media to\r\nthe subendothelial space. Together, these in vitro experiments demonstrate\r\nthat elastin is a potent and specific regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nmaturation, migration and proliferation. \r\nElastin signals via a non-integrin, G-protein coupled signaling\r\npathway\r\nTo determine whether elastin has a direct signaling effect, we examined the\r\nmolecular mechanism of the regulation by elastin of vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells. Though various binding proteins, chaperones and other matrix elements\r\nthat interact with elastin have been identified and cloned, the mechanism of\r\nelastin signaling remains', ' to be elucidated\r\n(Mecham and Hinek, 1986;\r\nHinek et al., 1988;\r\nMecham et al., 1991; Grosso et\r\nal., 1991b; Hinek, 1995;\r\nHinek, 1996;\r\nPrivitera et al., 1998). Using\r\nin vitro assays of migration and actin polymerization, we examined the\r\nsignaling cascade stimulated by elastin in Eln-/- vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells. Above, we demonstrate that elastin mediates actin\r\npolymerization through a Rho mediated signal transduction pathway\r\n(Fig. 2E). Cell-surface\r\nreceptors that are known to regulate the Rho signaling pathway include the\r\nintegrins and G-protein-coupled receptors\r\n(Seasholtz et al., 1999;\r\nWei et al., 2001). Integrins\r\nare a well-characterized family of receptors that recognize matrix proteins\r\nsuch as collagen, vitronectin, fibulin and fibronectin. Although elastin is\r\nnot a known ligand for integrins, recent work suggests that the integrins may\r\nbe involved in elastin signaling through an intermediary, fibulin 5\r\n(Nakamura et al., 2002;\r\nYanagisawa et al., 2002).\r\nFibulin 5 interacts directly with elastin, and serves as a ligand for\r\ncell-surface integrins. Integrins require extracellular divalent cations to\r\nbind their matrix ligands, and low doses of chelators such as EDTA block these\r\ncell-matrix interactions (Brockdorff et\r\nal., 1998). As expected, control experiments demonstrated that\r\nintegrin mediated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells to collagen was\r\nEDTA sensitive (Fig. 4A).\r\nHowever, EDTA did not interfere with tropoelastin-mediated migration or actin\r\npolymerization of Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 4A,B). In addition,\r\nblocking antibodies to integrins known to bind other matrix proteins such as\r\ncollagen and fibulin 5 did not perturb elastin-mediated actin polymerization\r\nor chemotaxis (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly suggest', ' that the\r\nintegrin family of receptors is not involved in elastin signaling. \r\nView larger version (31K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 4. Tropoelastin regulates migration and actin polymerization via a\r\nnon-integrin, G-protein-coupled signaling pathway. (A)\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to recombinant\r\ntropoelastin in an EDTA insensitive manner. By comparison, we show that\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell migration to collagen, which is mediated by\r\nintegrins, is EDTA sensitive. (B) Tropoelastin mediated actin polymerization\r\nof Eln-/- cells is EDTA insensitive. (C) Migration of\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells towards tropoelastin\r\nis pertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments with the B protomer of\r\npertussis toxin alone demonstrate that the effect of pertussis toxin is\r\nspecific to its ability to inhibit G-protein signaling. The migration of\r\nEln-/- cells to PDGF (30 ng/ml) is insensitive to\r\npertussis toxin. This control experiment demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- cells treated with pertussis toxin can respond\r\nnormally to stimuli other than tropoelastin. (D) Tropoelastin-mediated actin\r\npolymerization of Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells is\r\npertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments demonstrate that the B protomer\r\nof pertussis toxin does not inhibit actin polymerization. Together, these\r\nexperiments indicate that tropoelastin regulates vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nthrough a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein signaling pathway. (E) Cholera\r\ntoxin (ctxn) and forskolin (frskln) increase the baseline levels of cAMP in\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells by constitutive\r\nactivation of the Gs pathway. In the presence of tropoelastin and\r\nforskolin, there is a marked decrease in cAMP. A similar decrease in cAMP\r\nlevels is observed when tropoelastin is added to cholera toxin pretreated\r\ncells. The reduction in cAMP was blocked by', ' pertussis toxin and not B-protomer\r\nindicating a Gi specific pathway. These experiments indicate that\r\ntropoelastin activates a receptor that signals through Gi to\r\ninhibit adenylate cyclase, and reduce cAMP levels. (F) Tropoelastin activates\r\nRhoA in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments\r\ndemonstrate that tropoelastin treatment of Eln-/- cells\r\nresults in a marked elevation of activated RhoA. This response is pertussis\r\ntoxin sensitive and B-protomer insensitive indicating that tropoelastin\r\nactivation of the Rho pathway requires Gi activity. (G) Proposed\r\nmolecular mechanism for tropoelastin-mediated actin polymerization in vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are the largest family of transmembrane\r\nreceptors and are known to activate Rho kinase\r\n(Seasholtz et al., 1999;\r\nMarinissen and Gutkind, 2001).\r\nGPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins classified into four protein\r\nfamilies: Gs, Gi, Gq and G12/13\r\n(Marinissen and Gutkind,\r\n2001). Pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of Gi\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000), blocked\r\ntropoelastin-mediated migration and actin polymerization of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (Fig. 4C,D). The\r\nspecificity of pertussis toxin inhibition was demonstrated in a series of\r\ncontrol experiments. First, migration of vascular smooth muscle cells to\r\nplatelet-derived growth factor is not dependent on a G-protein-coupled\r\nsignaling pathway and was not disrupted by pertussis toxin\r\n(Fig. 4C). Second, pertussis\r\ntoxin is composed of two subunits, A and B\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000). The A\r\nprotomer inhibits Gi by ADP ribosylation, while the B protomer\r\nfacilitates the entry of the toxin into the cell. In the presence of B\r\nprotomer alone, there was no disruption of either migration or actin\r', '\npolymerization (Fig. 4C,D). Using a Ca2+-sensitive dye, fura-2, and immunoprecipitations with\r\nspecific antibodies, we detected no evidence that rapid Ca2+\r\ninflux, tyrosine kinase receptors or the Map kinase pathway was involved in\r\nelastin signaling (data not shown). Together, these experiments indicate that\r\nelastin signaling is mediated via a non-integrin and pertussis toxin-sensitive\r\nG-protein-coupled signaling pathway. \r\nThe pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, Gi, inhibits adenylate\r\ncyclase, the enzyme responsible for generating cAMP\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000). To\r\nobtain direct biochemical evidence that tropoelastin signals through\r\nGi, we measured the level of cAMP in tropoelastin-treated cells. To\r\nmeasure a reduction in cAMP level, it was necessary to increase the baseline\r\ncellular levels of cAMP using either forskolin or cholera toxin, agents that\r\nactivate adenylate cyclase (Thomas et al.,\r\n2000; Coward et al.,\r\n1999). When tropoelastin was added to either forskolin or cholera\r\ntoxin pretreated cells, the reduction in cAMP levels was between 40 and 60%,\r\nindicating that Gi was activated and inhibited adenylate cyclase\r\nactivity (Fig. 4E). These\r\nreductions in cAMP levels are comparable with those observed with other\r\nligands known to activate Gi via known G-protein-coupled receptors\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000;\r\nCoward et al., 1999). The\r\nreduction in cAMP was pertussis toxin sensitive, which confirmed the role of\r\nGi. Thus, tropoelastin activates Gi and reduces cAMP\r\nlevels. Finally, consistent with the activation of Gi, we found no evidence\r\nfor rapid Ca2+ influx, a prominent feature of Gq\r\nactivation, in our cellular system. Although GPCRs activate the Gi\r\npathway and ligands for many of these receptors have not been identified, our\r\ndata does not rule out the possibility that elastin might indirectly activate\r\nthe GPCR pathway at the level of the heterotrimeric G', ' proteins. \r\nOthers have shown that the GPCRs pathway can trigger the Rho signaling\r\ncascade (Seasholtz et al.,\r\n1999; Wei et al.,\r\n2001; Kabarowski et al.,\r\n2000). In this cascade, activated RhoA stimulates Rho kinase. We\r\nexamined whether tropoelastin stimulated the RhoA signaling pathway via\r\nactivation of a G-protein-coupled signaling pathway. Immunoprecipitation\r\nexperiments demonstrate that tropoelastin activates RhoA through a pertussis\r\ntoxin-sensitive mechanism (Fig.\r\n4F). Together, our pharmacological and biochemical data lead us to\r\npropose a molecular mechanism for elastin signaling\r\n(Fig. 4G). In vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells, elastin activates a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein-coupled\r\npathway that stimulates Gi, inhibits adenylate cyclase, reduces\r\ncAMP levels and stimulates Rho induced actin polymerization. In the absence of\r\nelastin synthesis, this mechanism is disrupted and vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells lose their contractile phenotype. Thus, there is a direct role for\r\nelastin in controlling vascular smooth muscle cells. \r\nElastin reduces the vascular proliferative response to arterial\r\ninjury in vivo\r\nThe in vitro experiments described above demonstrated that elastin is an\r\nautocrine factor that induces a contractile state, inhibits proliferation and\r\nlocalizes vascular smooth muscle cells to the vessel wall. These data suggest\r\nthat disruption of a crucial morphogenic signal in the vessel wall may release\r\nsmooth muscle cells to dedifferentiate, proliferate and occlude mature\r\narteries. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we used a porcine model to\r\ndetermine whether the application of exogenous elastin to a site of vascular\r\ninjury would reduce the neointimal accumulation of smooth muscle cells and\r\narterial stenosis. \r\nPorous sheaths of elastin matrix were generated from porcine carotid\r\narteries using established methods (Malone\r\net al., 1984). The purity of the elastin was confirmed by scanning\r\nelectron microscopy (Fig. 5A),\r\nimmunohistochemistry,', ' amino acid composition and desmosine content\r\n(Starcher, 1977) (data not\r\nshown). The amino acid composition and the concentration of the crosslinking\r\namino acids desmosine, isodesmosine and lysinonorleucine revealed no\r\nmicrofibrillar proteins or other impurities. Elastin sheaths were secured to\r\nintracoronary stents (Fig. 5B)\r\nand successfully deployed in porcine coronary arteries using standard\r\ncatheterization techniques. The biocompatibility of elastin sheaths was\r\nassessed 3 days and 14 days after placement in the porcine coronary artery.\r\nElastin sheaths did not evoke an inflammatory or thrombotic response (data not\r\nshown). Moreover, elastin sheaths were biologically stable and did not degrade\r\nwithin the arterial wall during the course of animal studies. These\r\nexperiments demonstrate that elastin sheaths can be used to restore elastin\r\nmatrix to sites of vascular injury. \r\nView larger version (80K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 5. Elastin therapy reduces vascular smooth muscle cell accumulation and\r\narterial obstruction in vivo. (A) Scanning electron micrographs of elastin\r\nsheaths. Scale bar: 10 µm. (B) Elastin matrix sheath covering an expanded\r\nmetal stent. (C,D) Representative cross-sections taken from control arteries\r\n(n=14) display the development of a thick fibrocellular neointima\r\n(C), whereas the neointima is substantially decreased in elastin sheath\r\n(arrows) treated arteries (n=13) with the same injury score (D).\r\n(E,F) Over a range of injury, the percent lumen stenosis (E) and mean\r\nneointimal thickness (F) were significantly reduced (both\r\nP<0.0001) in injured porcine coronary arteries treated with\r\nelastin sheath-stents compared with control stents.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo determine if elastin sheaths would reduce vascular smooth muscle\r\naccumulation and neointimal formation, we used an established porcine coronary\r\ninjury model of', ' in-stent restenosis\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1992;\r\nSchwartz et al., 1994). Two\r\nmajor coronary arteries of domestic pigs received either a control stent or an\r\nelastin sheath-covered stent following vascular injury caused by balloon\r\noverexpansion. Four weeks after injury and stent placement, representative\r\ncross-sections taken from control arteries displayed a thick fibrocellular\r\nneointima (Fig. 5C). By\r\ncontrast, neointimal formation was substantially reduced in elastin\r\nsheath-treated arteries (Fig.\r\n5D). Standard measurements of mean neointimal thickness (NIT) and\r\npercent stenosis were measured and correlated with the degree of injury\r\ninduced by stent placement. The well-established correlation between the\r\nseverity of injury and the amount of neointimal accumulation\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1994) is\r\nreproduced in our experiments with the control stents. Throughout the range of\r\ninjury scores, there is a significant reduction in the NIT and percent\r\nstenosis in elastin sheath-treated arteries, with the greatest benefit at the\r\nhighest injury scores (Fig.\r\n5E,F). At a mean injury score of 2, when stent placement disrupts\r\ninternal elastic lamella and lacerates the arterial media, elastin sheaths\r\nreduced the mean neointimal thickness by 52% as compared with controls. The\r\nspecificity of the effect of elastin as a stent coating is supported by the\r\nwork of our group and others with non-elastin sheaths. Sheaths made from\r\ncollagen, fibrin or synthetic biopolymers failed to reduce neointimal\r\nthickness compared with bare stents and were frequently associated with a\r\nworse outcome (Goodwin et al.,\r\n2000; McKenna et al.,\r\n1998; van der Giessen et al.,\r\n1996; van Beusekom et al.,\r\n1998). Thus, consistent with the in vitro results, our in vivo\r\nexperiments indicate that restoration of elastin matrix to a site of injury\r\nreduces vascular smooth muscle accumulation and limits neointimal\r\nformation. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTOP', '\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nElastin is a critical regulatory molecule within the arterial\r\nwall\r\nWe conclude that elastin is a critical regulatory molecule that controls\r\nthe phenotypic modulation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells. This conclusion is based on the following observations. First,\r\ncells that lack elastin proliferate at a rate twofold greater than wild-type\r\ncells. Second, cells that lack elastin fail to form a mature contractile\r\nphenotype, which is characteristic of wild-type cells. Third, cells that lack\r\nelastin migrate more aggressively to an exogenous chemoattractant than\r\nwild-type cells. Fourth, all of these aberrant phenotypes induced by the\r\nabsence of elastin can be rescued in vitro by the addition of recombinant\r\ntropoelastin. Fifth, elastin exerts its regulatory function on vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells by activating a G-protein coupled signaling pathway. Finally,\r\nrestoring elastin to a site of vascular injury in vivo reduces the neointimal\r\naccumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, elastin matrix deposited\r\nby vascular smooth muscle cells in the arterial media provides a local cue\r\nthat regulates these cells in vitro and in vivo. \r\nElastin-VSMC signaling is a critical morphogenic signal that is\r\ndisrupted during the pathogenesis of vascular disease\r\nVascular smooth muscle cells are able to exist in a quiescent contractile\r\nstate or a proliferative non-contractile state\r\n(Raines and Ross, 1993;\r\nOwens, 1998). This plasticity\r\nenables the vascular system to regenerate and grow. However, plasticity must\r\nbe balanced by the need to maintain a mature and stable structure capable of\r\ncirculating blood throughout a whole animal. Because vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells modulate their phenotype readily, external factors must instruct them to\r\nremain in a mature state if homeostasis is to be achieved. Our data indicate\r\nthat the elastin matrix is a potent autocrine factor that regulates arterial\r\nmorphogenesis by instructing vascular smooth muscle cells to', ' localize around\r\nthe elastic fibers in organized rings and remain in a quiescent, contractile\r\nstate (Fig. 6A). This\r\ncell-matrix interaction is mediated via a heterotrimeric G-protein signaling\r\npathway that activates downstream rho GTPases and appears to be crucial for\r\nstabilizing and maintaining the structure of the mature artery. When this\r\nmorphogenic signal is absent during arterial development, the unregulated\r\nmigration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells results in\r\nocclusion of the arterial lumen (Li et\r\nal., 1998) (Fig.\r\n6B). This leads us to propose that focal disruption or destruction\r\nof the elastin matrix in the mature artery by factors such as mechanical\r\ninjury or inflammation play an important and direct role in the fibrocellular\r\nresponse characteristic of proliferative vascular diseases\r\n(Fig. 6C). Previously, emphasis\r\nwas placed on the pivotal role of inflammatory cells in regulating vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors\r\n(Lusis, 2000;\r\nRoss, 1995). In our model, the\r\ndegradation of elastin by macrophages, T-cells and their proteases acts to\r\nrelease vascular smooth muscle cells from their mature contractile state to\r\nmigrate, proliferate and form a neointima. Thus, the disruption of an\r\nessential morphogenic signal contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular\r\ndisease. \r\nView larger version (37K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 6. Model of elastin-vascular smooth muscle cell interactions in development\r\nand disease. (A) During normal development, vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nsynthesize and secrete elastin polymers that form concentric rings of elastic\r\nlamellae around the arterial lumen. Elastin provides mechanical support to the\r\nvessel wall, and signals vascular smooth muscle cells to localize around the\r\nelastic lamellae and remain in a quiescent, contractile state. (B) In the\r\nabsence of elastin, this morphogenic signal is lost resulting in pervasive\r\nsubendothelial migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nthat occludes the', ' vascular lumen. (C) This leads us to propose that the focal\r\ndisruption and/or destruction of elastin in the mature artery by vascular\r\ninjury releases smooth muscle cells to dedifferentiate, migrate and\r\nproliferate, and contributes to neointimal formation.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nFour lines of evidence support our model of elastin-vascular smooth muscle\r\nsignaling in the pathogenesis of vascular proliferative diseases. \r\nPathology\r\nDisruption of elastin matrix is consistently associated with vascular\r\nproliferative diseases in human pathological specimens\r\n(Sandberg et al., 1981;\r\nSims, 2000;\r\nSims et al., 1989). Moreover,\r\nthe severity of occlusive vascular pathology increases in proportion to the\r\nmagnitude of defects and discontinuities in the elastin matrix\r\n(Sims et al., 1989). It has\r\nalso been noted that the programmed intimal hyperplasia and arterial occlusion\r\nrequired for the closure of the ductus arteriosis is associated with impaired\r\nelastic fiber formation (Hinek et al.,\r\n1991). \r\nGenetic\r\nWe previously showed in human genetic studies that loss-of-function\r\nmutations in elastin is sufficient to cause a human vascular proliferative\r\ndisease, supravalvular aortic stenosis and Williams-Beuren syndrome\r\n(Li et al., 1997;\r\nCurran et al., 1993; Ewart,\r\n1993). In these diseases, there is an aggressive occlusive pathology that\r\ndevelops throughout the arterial tree of affected children in the absence of\r\ncommon risk factors for vascular disease. \r\nExperimental\r\nIn murine gene-targeting experiments, we demonstrated that loss of elastin\r\nis sufficient to cause occlusive vascular pathology\r\n(Li et al., 1998). This\r\npathology was caused by the unregulated proliferation, migration and\r\naccumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the subendothelial space\r\n(Fig. 6B). In this model,\r\nsevere arterial obstruction occurs in the absence of an inflammatory response\r\nor hemodynamic stress. \r\nTherapeutic\r\nIn this manuscript, we show that exogenous tropoelastin can control the\r\nprol', 'iferation, migration and maturation of vascular smooth muscle cells in\r\nvitro, and reduce the development of fibrocellular pathology in vivo. Other\r\ninvestigators have shown that matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, which\r\nprevent the degradation of matrix components, can reduce neointimal formation\r\n(Zaidi et al., 2000).\r\nTogether, these data indicate that the destruction of the elastin matrix is a\r\ncritical step in the fibrocellular response characteristic of vascular\r\nproliferative disorders. Although strongly indicative, definitive proof of a\r\nrole for elastin signaling in a vascular proliferative response requires\r\nfurther studies. \r\nElastin is unique among vascular extracellular matrix proteins\r\nThe extracellular matrix is known to play a crucial function in the\r\nregulation of vascular smooth muscle cell biology. The myriad associations and\r\ninteraction between the many structural proteins, proteoglycans and growth\r\nfactors of the vascular matrix makes it difficult to distinguish the effects\r\nof each element from one another. However, numerous in vitro studies have\r\ndemonstrated the ability of matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin and\r\nlaminin to affect vascular smooth muscle cell activity, including phenotypic\r\nmodulation, migration and proliferation\r\n(Raines, 2000;\r\nHedin et al., 1999). These\r\ndata might suggest that there is overlap and redundancy with regard to the\r\nfunction of different vascular matrix proteins. Elastin, however, is unique\r\namong matrix elements in that the disruption of this gene leads to a vascular\r\nproliferative pathology in human and animal models. Disruption of other genes\r\nencoding vascular matrix proteins, including fibulin, fibrillin and collagen\r\nis associated with either arterial tortuosity, dissection or aneurysm\r\nformation in vivo, not proliferative or occlusive vascular pathology\r\n(Nakamura et al., 2002;\r\nYanagisawa et al., 2002;\r\nArteaga-Solis et al., 2000;\r\nDietz and Mecham, 2000).\r\nMoreover, the specificity of the effect of elastin in vivo is supported by\r\nstudies showing that collagen matrix-covered stents do not reduce neointimal\r\nformation in a porcine model of restenosis\r\n', '(Goodwin et al., 2000). Thus,\r\nelastin, when compared with other matrix proteins, is effective in both in\r\nvitro and in vivo experimental models. From these studies one would expect\r\nthat targeted disruption of the elastin signaling mechanism would replicate\r\nphenotypes observed in Eln-/- cell and mice. \r\nRestoration of elastin for the treatment of proliferative vascular\r\ndiseases\r\nOur work suggests that understanding the link between vascular development\r\nand disease may provide an alternative and potentially complementary strategy\r\nfor the treatment of vascular proliferative diseases. Previously, emphasis has\r\nbeen placed on improving the outcome of vascular disease by inhibiting smooth\r\nmuscle cell proliferation with coronary stents coated with either\r\nradioactivity or chemotherapeutic drugs such as rapamycin, actinomycin D and\r\npaclitaxil (Heldman et al.,\r\n2001; Leon et al.,\r\n2001; Sousa et al.,\r\n2001). These treatments use a common strategy of disrupting\r\nfundamental pathways such as microtubule assembly, DNA stability, and\r\nregulatory cell cycle proteins that are required in virtually all actively\r\ndividing cells. We present work that suggests restoring a natural morphogenic\r\nsignal to the vessel wall may also be therapeutically beneficial. Clearly,\r\nadditional work is needed to verify that results with murine and porcine\r\nmodels are recapitulated in humans. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\xa0\r\nWe thank Bob Mecham for assistance with synthesizing recombinant\r\ntropoelastin, confirming the purity of the elastin sheath and recombinant\r\ntropoelastin, providing the polyclonal murine tropoelastin antibody, and\r\ndiscussions; Roy Biran (Keck Center for Tissue Engineering) for antibodies and\r\nhelp with fluorescent imaging; and Mary Scriven for assistance in generating\r\nmanuscript figures.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are the largest family of transmembrane
receptors and are known to activate Rho kinase
(Seasholtz et al., 1999;
Marinissen and Gutkind, 2001).
GPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins classified into four protein
families: Gs, Gi, Gq and G12/13
(Marinissen and Gutkind,
2001). Pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of Gi
(Thomas et al., 2000), blocked
tropoelastin-mediated migration and actin polymerization of vascular smooth
muscle cells (Fig. 4C,D). The
specificity of pertussis toxin inhibition was demonstrated in a series of
control experiments. First, migration of vascular smooth muscle cells to
platelet-derived growth factor is not dependent on a G-protein-coupled
signaling pathway and was not disrupted by pertussis toxin
(Fig. 4C). Second, pertussis
toxin is composed of two subunits, A and B
(Thomas et al., 2000). The A
protomer inhibits Gi by ADP ribosylation, while the B protomer
facilitates the entry of the toxin into the cell. In the presence of B
protomer alone, there was no disruption of either migration or actin",12466207-20,"['12466207-0', '12466207-1', '12466207-2', '12466207-3', '12466207-4', '12466207-5', '12466207-6', '12466207-7', '12466207-8', '12466207-9', '12466207-10', '12466207-11', '12466207-12', '12466207-13', '12466207-14', '12466207-15', '12466207-16', '12466207-17', '12466207-18', '12466207-19', '12466207-20', '12466207-21', '12466207-22', '12466207-23', '12466207-24', '12466207-25', '12466207-26', '12466207-27', '12466207-28', '12466207-29', '12466207-30', '12466207-31', '12466207-32', '12466207-33', '12466207-34', '12466207-35', '12466207-36', '12466207-37', '12466207-38', '12466207-39']","['\r\nA critical role for elastin signaling in vascular morphogenesis and disease\r\nSatyajit K.

This fibrocellular response has largely been\r\nattributed to the release of multiple cytokines and growth factors by\r\ninflammatory cells. Previously, we demonstrated that the disruption of the\r\nel', 'astin matrix leads to defective arterial morphogenesis. Here, we propose\r\nthat elastin is a potent autocrine regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nactivity and that this regulation is important for preventing fibrocellular\r\npathology. Using vascular smooth muscle cells from mice lacking elastin\r\n(Eln-/-), we show that elastin induces actin stress fiber\r\norganization, inhibits proliferation, regulates migration and signals via a\r\nnon-integrin, heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled pathway. In a porcine coronary\r\nmodel of restenosis, the therapeutic delivery of exogenous elastin to injured\r\nvessels in vivo significantly reduces neointimal formation. These findings\r\nindicate that elastin stabilizes the arterial structure by inducing a\r\nquiescent contractile state in vascular smooth muscle cells. Together, this\r\nwork demonstrates that signaling pathways crucial for arterial morphogenesis\r\ncan play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of vascular\r\ndisease. \r\nKey words: Elastin matrix, Vascular smooth muscle, Morphogenesis, G-protein signaling, Vascular proliferative diseases\r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nVascular proliferative diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that\r\ninclude atherosclerosis, coronary restenosis, bypass-graft failure and\r\ntransplant arteriopathy that lead to arterial narrowing, restriction of blood\r\nflow and tissue ischemia. These diseases arise from a complex\r\npathophysiological response to injury by multiple factors, including\r\nhypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, hypertension and mechanical injury\r\n(Ross, 1995;\r\nLusis, 2000). Although their\r\netiologies are diverse, these disorders all share a common pathological\r\nfeature: the accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells and fibrous\r\nconnective tissue within the intima between the endothelium and medial layer\r\nof the vessel wall (Lusis,\r\n2000; Raines and Ross,\r\n1993). This fibrocellular pathology, known as neointimal\r\nformation, results from the activation, proliferation and migration', ' of\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (Raines and\r\nRoss, 1993; Schwartz,\r\n1997). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell regulation is crucial for developing strategies to\r\nprevent and treat vascular proliferative disorders. \r\n \r\nVascular smooth muscle cells are not terminally differentiated and can\r\nalternate between a quiescent, contractile state and a proliferative\r\nnon-contractile state (Raines and Ross,\r\n1993; Owens, 1998;\r\nThyberg, 1998). In a healthy\r\nartery, vascular smooth muscle cells are quiescent and largely comprise a\r\ncontractile apparatus that functions to dilate and constrict the lumen as\r\nrequired by physiological demands. Actin stress fibers serve as the scaffold\r\nfor the contractile apparatus, and are a hallmark of mature and quiescent\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (Burridge and\r\nChrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996;\r\nSmall and Gimona, 1998). Under\r\ncircumstances of injury, repair and regeneration, vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nlose their contractile apparatus and dedifferentiate into an immature\r\nphenotype capable of proliferating and depositing extracellular matrix\r\n(Owens, 1998;\r\nThyberg, 1998). This\r\nfibrocellular response plays an important role in all forms of vascular\r\nproliferative diseases. In atherosclerotic lesions, the major components of\r\nthe fibrous plaque are vascular smooth muscle cells, the matrix products\r\ndeposited by these cells, and extracellular cholesterol\r\n(Ross, 1995;\r\nLusis, 2000;\r\nRaines and Ross, 1993). In\r\nrestenosis, transplant arteriopathy and vascular graft disease; smooth muscle\r\ncells are the predominant component of the occlusive lesion\r\n(Raines and Ross, 1993). The\r\nphenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells offers a tempting target\r\nfor preventing vascular proliferative diseases. \r\nElastin is the dominant extracellular matrix protein deposited in the\r\narterial wall and can contribute up to 50% of its dry weight\r\n(Parks et al., 1993). The\r\nprotein product of the elastin gene is synthesized by vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells', ' and secreted as a monomer, tropoelastin. After post-translational\r\nmodification, tropoelastin is crosslinked and organized into elastin polymers\r\nthat form concentric rings of elastic lamellae around the arterial lumen. Each\r\nelastic lamella alternates with a ring of smooth muscle, and provides the\r\ncompliance that arteries need to absorb and transmit hemodynamic force\r\n(Wolinski et al., 1967). There\r\nis a growing body of evidence that implicates elastin in vascular development\r\nand disease. We previously demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations of one\r\nelastin allele cause supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and Williams-Beuren\r\nSyndrome (Li et al., 1997;\r\nCurran et al., 1993;\r\nEwart et al., 1993). These\r\ndisorders are characterized by discrete fibrocellular stenoses in the aorta,\r\ncoronary arteries, carotid arteries, pulmonary arteries and other peripheral\r\narteries. Often, individuals with these diseases are young children who are\r\nsusceptible to peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarctions or stroke\r\nin the absence of other risk factors such as high serum cholesterol, diabetes\r\nand cigarette smoking (van Son et al.,\r\n1994). In subsequent experiments, we showed that the deposition of\r\nelastin matrix in the arterial wall during late fetal development is essential\r\nto arterial morphogenesis (Li et al.,\r\n1998). Mice that lack elastin (Eln-/-) died\r\nfrom occlusive fibrocellular pathology caused by subendothelial proliferation\r\nand accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in early neonatal life. In\r\nEln-/- vessels, there is no evidence of abnormal\r\nendothelial structure, activation or proliferation. Furthermore, the occlusive\r\nvascular phenotype occurred in the absence of hemodynamic stress and\r\ninflammation. This work demonstrated that elastin is required for arterial\r\ndevelopment. However, because the absence of elastin undoubtedly distorts the\r\npresentation and stability of other important elements of the matrix\r\narchitecture, these studies failed to define the specific role for elastin in\r\nestablishing and maintaining a mature artery. \r', ""\nHere we show that elastin regulates the phenotypic modulation,\r\nproliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. We\r\nconfirm a direct signaling effect by demonstrating that elastin regulates\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells via a G-protein-coupled signaling pathway.\r\nFinally, we establish that in vivo, exogenous elastin reduces the vascular\r\nproliferative response of an injured artery. These results demonstrate that\r\nelastin is a crucial signaling molecule that directly controls vascular smooth\r\nmuscle biology and stabilizes arterial structure. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nIsolation of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nNewborn (postnatal day 0.5) Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- pups were sacrificed by CO2\r\nasphyxiation. Their ascending aortas were dissected free, endothelium removed\r\nand placed into individual wells of a plastic 12-well culture dish containing\r\nAmniomax C-100 growth medium (Gibco-BRL) supplemented with\r\npenicillin/streptomycin. Cultures of smooth muscle cells that formed around\r\nthe tissue were trypsinized (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA), passaged, expanded\r\nand genotyped to confirm their identity. Cells were stained with SM\r\n-actin (Clone 1A4, Sigma) and checked for classic `hill-and-valley'\r\nmorphology to confirm their smooth muscle status. In situ hybridization,\r\nimmunostaining and RT/PCR analysis established that these cells expressed the\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell markers SM -actin, SM -actin, SM-22,\r\ncalponin, desmin, ang-1/ang-2, and did not express the endothelial markers\r\nFlk-1 or Flt-1. \r\nCellular assays\r\nCellular experiments of proliferation, actin polymerization and migration\r\ndescribed below were performed on at least three independently isolated\r\nprimary cell lines. Proliferation was assayed by"", ' cell count and\r\n[3H]thymidine incorporation. Confluent cultures of\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells from the fourth passage were seeded at a density of\r\n2x103 cells/well on a plastic 24-well plate (Corning Costar,\r\nCorning, NY), and stimulated to proliferate in AmnioMAX C-100 growth medium\r\n(Gibco-BRL) treated with 100 µg/ml recombinant tropoelastin or left\r\nuntreated. Cell numbers for each culture were assayed by hemocytometer after\r\n24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. For [3H]thymidine incorporation,\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- cells were seeded at\r\na density of 20,000 cells/well on a 24-well plate. After attachment, cells\r\nwere starved in 0.1% BSA (Fisher) in Amniomax Basal Medium (Gibco) for 24\r\nhours. Cells were then grown in whole Amniomax medium treated/untreated with\r\n100 µg/ml tropoelastin (Grosso et al., 1991a). Cells were assayed for\r\n[3H]thymidine incorporation using a scintillation counter after 24\r\nhours by precipitating with 5% TCA, followed by NaOH solubilization. Data were\r\ncalculated as mean±s.d. (n=6). \r\nSubconfluent cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells were evaluated and\r\nscored for the presence of actin stress fibers in the cytoplasm following\r\nimmunofluorescent staining for SM -actin (Clone 1A4, Sigma), vinculin\r\n(Clone hVin-1, Sigma), desmin (Sigma) and tubulin (Clone DM-1A, Calbiochem).\r\nCells were treated with tropoelastin (1 µg/ml) (Grosso et al., 1991a) or\r\nnot, and assays were performed in serum-free media. Cells were scored as\r\ncontractile if they had distinct actin stress fibers continuous throughout the\r\ncytoplasm, or at least 10 well-defined focal adhesions distributed throughout\r\nthe cytoplasm and cell', ' periphery. Scoring was performed by three separate\r\nobservers blinded to the cell genotypes, and their numbers averaged. At least\r\n100 cells were scored in three separate cultures for each genotype.\r\nAdditionally, identical results were obtained for cells cultured on glass\r\nslides, 24 plastic tissue culture plates (Corning) coated with matrigel, and\r\nanother brand of plasticware (Falcon). \r\nThe chemotactic activity of cells was assayed in a modification of the\r\nBoyden chamber method using 6.5 mm transwell polycarbonate chemotaxis filter\r\ninserts in a plastic 24-well tissue culture plate (Corning Costar, Corning,\r\nNY). Various concentrations of recombinant tropoelastin (Grosso et al., 1991a)\r\nwere placed in both the upper or lower compartment and covered with a\r\npolycarbonate membrane filter (8 µm porosity). PDGF-BB (30 ng/ml) was added\r\nto the lower chamber and served as a positive control. Medium alone was used\r\nas the negative control. Cells to be tested were placed in the upper wells of\r\nthe chamber and incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 3 hours. After\r\nincubation, the cells adhering to the upper surface of the filter were scraped\r\noff and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface were fixed with 10%\r\nbuffered formalin, stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and viewed\r\nunder a mercury lamp. Fifteen randomly selected high power (x200) fields\r\nwere counted on each filter by observers blinded to their conditions.\r\nChemotactic response was measured as the number of cells that had transversed\r\nthe filter in response to tropoelastin, PDGF and collagen type I (10\r\nµg/ml), and expressed as fold increase over baseline. Each condition was\r\nassayed in triplicate wells and each experiment was repeated at least three\r\ntimes. Actin polymerization and migration assays experiments were also\r\nperformed in triplicate in the presence of 100 µM Actinomycin D\r\n(Calbiochem), 10 µg/ml Cycloheximide (Calbiochem), 20 µM Y27632\r\n(Welfide), 20 µM ED', 'TA, 100 ng/ml Ptxn (Calbiochem) or 100 ng/ml B-protomer\r\n(Calbiochem). \r\nMeasurement of cAMP and activated Rho A\r\nAll biochemical measurements were performed in cells that were serum\r\nstarved overnight. cAMP assay levels were detected using an RIA kit (RPA538,\r\nAmersham Pharmacia). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 80,000 to\r\n100,000 cells on a plastic 12-well cell-culture plate, pretreated with 100\r\nng/ml cholera toxin (Calbiochem) for 3 hours, treated with 1 µg/ml\r\nrecombinant tropoelastin for 20 minutes, and cAMP subsequently isolated.\r\nExperimental cAMP levels were quantified through use of a standard curve where\r\nknown amounts of cAMP were added to radioimmunoassay. \r\nRhoA-GTP was detected using a Rho Activation Kit (Upstate Biotechnology).\r\nBriefly, Eln-/- cells were grown to 70% confluence in a\r\nsix-well plate, and pretreated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin or 100 ng/ml\r\nB-protomer for 3 hours. Control experiments with no pretreatment were also\r\nperformed. Cells were then treated with 1 µg/ml recombinant tropoelastin\r\nfor 3 hours and activated Rho A was isolated by immunoprecipitations with\r\nRhotekin coated beads. RhoA-GTP was detected by western blot analysis after\r\nsamples were run on a 10% acryllamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose\r\nmembranes. Equal amounts of total cellular lysate were run out for each sample\r\nto ensure that equivalent amounts of protein were used in all experiments. \r\nPorcine coronary model of in-stent restenosis\r\nElastin sheaths were prepared from dissected common carotid arteries of\r\nadult domestic swine (40 to 60 kg) using a variation of a previously published\r\nprotocol (Malone et al.,\r\n1984). Briefly, these vessels were sequentially treated with a 1%\r\nSDS solution supplemented with doxycycline (10 mg/l) and EDTA (5 mM),', '\r\npotassium hydroxide (5 N) at 60°C, collagenase solution (0.5 mg/ml,\r\nCollagenase D, Roche), autoclaved and  irradiated. The product of these\r\nextractions, a tubular elastin matrix sheath, was cut to size and fitted over\r\n14 mm long stainless steel expandable stents (Medtronic AVE, S670) mounted on\r\n3.5 mm diameter angioplasty balloons and secured by a metal coil. Control\r\nstents deployed were identical to elastin covered stents except for the\r\nabsence of elastin sheaths. \r\nNineteen domestic pigs (30 to 40 kg) on a normal diet were pretreated with\r\noral aspirin (625 mg), ticlopidine (250 mg) and verapamil (120 mg), and placed\r\nunder general anesthesia. Animals underwent placement of 32 stents in the left\r\nanterior descending, circumflex or right coronary artery. The methods of stent\r\nimplantation have been previously described\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1994).\r\nBriefly, control stents or elastin sheath-covered stents were advanced under\r\nfluoroscopic guidance to an appropriate site in the coronary vasculature and\r\ndeployed at a 1.2:1 to 1.4:1 stent-to-artery ratio compared with the baseline\r\nvessel diameter. After the procedure, the wounds were closed and the pigs were\r\nreturned to their quarters on a normal diet. Pigs were sacrificed at day 3\r\n(elastin-covered stent, n=2) and day 14 (elastin-covered stent,\r\nn=2) to assess biocompatibility of the elastin sheath. To study\r\nneointima formation, pigs were sacrificed at day 28 (control stents,\r\nn=15; elastin-covered stents, n=14) and instrumented\r\narteries were removed. Coronary arteries were fixed by pressure perfusion (100\r\nmm Hg) with 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours, dissected free, washed,\r\ndehydrated through graded alcohols and infiltrated with methylmethacrylate\r\n(MMA) at 4°C. After polymerization,', ' embedded specimens were\r\ncross-sectioned at 5 µm thickness using a tungsten-carbide microtome blade.\r\nEach arterial segment was stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and elastic Van\r\nGieson stains. Three cross-sections taken from the two ends and the middle of\r\neach artery were used for histomorphometric analysis. Histological examination\r\nconfirmed that the elastin sheaths were retained in the arterial wall of all\r\nspecimens. \r\nHistomorphometric analysis\r\nMean neointimal thickness, percent stenosis and mean injury score were\r\nmeasured on Van Gieson-stained sections using calibrated digital microscopic\r\nplanimetry as previously described\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1992;\r\nSchwartz et al., 1994).\r\nBriefly, the mean neointimal thickness was measured by drawing a radial line\r\nfrom the lumen border to the point maximum penetration for each stent strut,\r\nand averaging the measurements. Percent area stenosis was calculated as %\r\nstenosis=100 x [1-(stenotic lumen area/original lumen area)]. The\r\noriginal lumen area was measured as the area subtended within the internal\r\nelastic lamina. The injury score measures the physical penetration of the\r\nstent strut into the vessel wall and was calculated using a graded scale from\r\n0-3 as previously described (Schwartz et\r\nal., 1992). Briefly, a score of 1 indicated that only the internal\r\nelastic lamina was lacerated; a score of 2 indicated laceration of the\r\narterial media; and a score of 3 indicated that the external elastic lamina\r\nwas lacerated. The mean injury score for each histological section was\r\ncalculated as mean injury score= injury scores for every strut/number\r\nof struts present per section. \r\nStatistics\r\nFor all in vitro experiments, mean and standard deviations were calculated\r\nand statistical analysis were carried out by analysis of variance (ANOVA). For\r\nin vivo experiments, statistical analysis was performed on injury score,\r\naverage neointimal thickness and percent lumen stenosis using regression\r\nmodeling (Schwartz et al.,\r\n1994). Linear regression modeling accounts for injury (a strong\r\ncovariate) and the injury-dependent ne', 'ointimal thickening between control\r\narteries and elastin treated arteries. Three models were used to establish\r\nwhether there were: (1) differences in intercepts, (2) differences in slopes\r\nallowing any intercept or (3) differences in slopes when the intercepts are\r\nfixed. Differences between the elastin sheath-stent and control stent at each\r\ninjury level were analyzed using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons\r\nt test for all three regression models. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nRESULTS\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nElastin inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells\r\nInvestigating the role of elastin in regulating vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells is confounded by the fact that these cells synthesize and secrete\r\nelastin. Thus, to determine the role of elastin in regulating cellular\r\nproliferation, differentiation and migration, we isolated vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells from mice lacking elastin (Eln-/-) and from\r\nwild-type sibling control animals (Eln+/+).\r\nImmunofluorescent staining and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction\r\n(RT-PCR) analyses established that Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells expressed and synthesized elastin (antibody to murine elastin\r\nkindly provided by Dr Robert Mecham, Washington University), whereas\r\nEln-/- cells did not\r\n(Fig. 1A-C). \r\nView larger version (64K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 1. Elastin inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. (A) RT-PCR\r\nexperiments confirm that murine vascular smooth muscle cells lines express\r\ncell specific markers. The elastin gene product is detected in\r\nEln+/+ and not Eln-/- cells.\r\nImmunofluorescence analysis with elastin antibodies and accompanying phase\r\nphotomicrographs demonstrate that Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (B) synthesize and secrete elastin matrix, whereas\r\nEln', '-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (C) do not produce\r\nelastin. (D) Assay measuring cell numbers demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate at a much\r\nhigher rate than do Eln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(P<0.0001, ANOVA). This difference is eliminated by the addition\r\nof recombinant elastin gene product or tropoelastin (tEln). (E) Assay\r\nmeasuring [3H]thymidine incorporation assay demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate at a rate\r\nover twofold greater than that for Eln+/+ cells. This\r\ndifference is eliminated by the inhibition of Eln-/- cells\r\nproliferation by tropoelastin (P<0.0001, ANOVA).\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo evaluate the role of elastin in vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nproliferation, we compared the growth rate of Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells. Cells were seeded at the same density and\r\ngrowth rates were assayed by counting cells after 24, 48 and 72 hours. The\r\nnumber of Eln-/- cells was greater than\r\nEln+/+ cells at all time points, and was increased over\r\ntwofold at 72 hours (Fig. 1D).\r\nThese data indicate that in the absence of elastin synthesis, vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells proliferate at an increased rate. \r\nTo prove the specificity of the effect of elastin on vascular smooth muscle\r\ncell growth, we tested whether adding exogenous recombinant tropoelastin to\r\nthe culture media inhibits cellular proliferation. Recombinant tropoelastin\r\nwas synthesized using a bacterial expression system (Grosso et al., 1991a) and\r\ndetermined to be pure by gel electrophoresis and amino acid composition.\r\nTropoelastin had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation, with a\r\nmaximal effect at 100 µg/ml (Fig.\r\n1D; data not shown). At this dose, the number of\r\nEln-/- cells was nearly identical to\r\nEln+/+ cells at 72 hours. At each time point, more than\r\n98% of all cells were viable as determined by Try', 'pan Blue staining, indicating\r\nthat tropoelastin was not cytotoxic. Similar results were observed when acid\r\nhydrolyzed elastic fibers,  elastin, were used for this assay. The\r\nresponses of Eln+/+ and Eln-/-\r\ncellular proliferation to tropoelastin\r\n(Fig. 1E) and  elastin\r\n(data not shown) were reproduced in [3H]thymidine incorporation\r\nassays. By comparison, there was no significant inhibitory effect on\r\nproliferation when Eln-/- cells were treated with type I\r\ncollagen (100 µg/ml) (data not shown). These data demonstrate that elastin\r\nregulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. \r\nElastin induces a mature contractile phenotype in vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells\r\nThe primary function of mature differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nis contraction. This ability requires highly organized actin myofilaments,\r\noften referred to as actin stress fibers\r\n(Burridge et al., 1996;\r\nSmall and Gimona, 1998). To\r\ndetermine if elastin modulates the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells,\r\nwe evaluated actin organization in Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells using direct immunofluorescent staining with\r\nFITC-conjugated SM -actin antisera. Well-defined actin myofilaments\r\nwere apparent in more than 95% of Eln+/+ cells scored by\r\nobservers blinded to genotype (Fig.\r\n2A,E). By contrast, only 23% of Eln-/- cells\r\nhad actin stress fibers (Fig.\r\n2B,E). Furthermore, Eln-/- cells with actin\r\nstress fibers were qualitatively different than Eln+/+\r\ncells, with a distinctive, rounder morphology (data not shown). These data\r\nindicate that vascular smooth muscle cells lacking elastin fail to organize\r\ntheir contractile apparatus. \r\nView larger version (57K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 2. Elastin induces a mature contractile phenotype in vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells. (A-E) Immunofluorescence analysis for SM -', 'actin reveals that\r\nEln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells (A) have a highly\r\norganized network of actin stress fibers, a hallmark of mature contractile\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells. By contrast, there is a paucity of actin stress\r\nfibers in Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (B; outlined\r\nby white dots). The elastin gene product, recombinant tropoelastin, induces\r\nthe formation of organized actin stress fibers in Eln-/-\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (D), but does not affect\r\nEln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells (C). Scoring analysis\r\ndemonstrates a significant increase in the percentage of\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells with organized actin\r\nmyofilaments after elastin treatment (P<0.0001) (E). Tropoelastin\r\nmediated actin polymerization is unaffected when Eln-/-\r\ncells are treated with either a gene transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D,\r\nor a protein translation inhibitor, cycloheximide. The Rho kinase inhibitor,\r\nY27632, blocks actin polymerization of tropoelastin treated\r\nEln-/- cells. (F-J) Immunofluorescence analysis for\r\nvinculin reveals that Eln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(F) have well-defined focal adhesions (arrowheads). By contrast,\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (G; outlined by white\r\ndots) have poorly defined focal adhesions. Tropoelastin induces well-defined\r\nfocal adhesions (arrows) throughout Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (I), but does not affect Eln+/+ vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells (H). Scoring analysis revealed a significant increase\r\n(P<0.0001) in the percentage of Eln-/-\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells with defined focal adhesions after tropoelastin\r\ntreatment (J). (K,L) Immunofluorescence staining with antisera against tubulin\r\nreveals no difference between Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (K) and Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(L). Exposure times for all images are the same.', ' Results represent the\r\nmean±s.d. from three individual experiments.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo confirm that the failure to form an organized contractile apparatus in\r\nEln-/- cells resulted from the inability to synthesize and\r\nsecrete elastin, we treated these cells with recombinant tropoelastin protein.\r\nWithin 3 hours of exposure to tropoelastin, the percentage of\r\nEln-/- cells with organized actin stress fibers increased\r\nthreefold to 74% (Fig. 2D,E).\r\nThis response was does dependent and was also seen by phallodin staining for\r\nF-actin (data not shown). By comparison, tropoelastin treatment had not effect\r\non actin stress fiber organization in Eln+/+ cells\r\n(Fig. 2C,E). Similar results\r\nwere observed when Eln-/- cells were treated with\r\ncrosslinked  elastin (data not shown). However, no change in actin\r\nstress fiber organization was observed when Eln-/- cells\r\nwere treated with an equivalent concentration of type I collagen. In addition,\r\nthe induction of actin polymerization by tropoelastin was unaffected by the\r\npresence or absence of serum in culture (data not shown). Thus, extracellular\r\nelastin is an important mediator of actin polymerization and contractile\r\napparatus organization in vascular smooth muscle cells. \r\nThe Rho signal transduction pathway is known to be a central converging\r\nstep in the formation of actin stress fibers through a post-translational\r\nmechanism (Mack et al., 2001;\r\nBishop and Hall, 2000). We\r\ninvestigated the role of this pathway in the regulation by tropoelastin of\r\nactin polymerization. The addition of actinomycin D\r\n(Greenburg et al., 1986), an\r\ninhibitor of gene transcription, or cycloheximide\r\n(Greenburg et al., 1986), an\r\ninhibitor of protein translation, did not block tropoelastin-induced actin\r\npolymerization in Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 2E). Furthermore, a\r\nspecific inhibitor of the Rho signaling pathway that targets Rho kinase,\r\nY276', '32 (Mack et al., 2001;\r\nUshata et al., 1997), blocked\r\ntropoelastin mediated actin polymerization of Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 2E). Additionally,\r\ntropoelastin treatment of Eln-/- vsmc did not alter the\r\namount of SM  actin transcript or protein levels as quantified by\r\nnorthern and western blot analysis but did shift the filamentous:globular\r\n(F:G) actin ratio from 1:1 to 3.1:1 (data not shown). These experiments, in\r\ncombination with the failure of either transcription or translation inhibitors\r\nto inhibit tropoelastin-induced actin stress fiber formation in\r\nEln-/- vsmc, suggest that elastin modulates vsmc phenotype\r\nby regulating actin treadmilling via a signal transduction pathway involving\r\nRho GTPases and their effector proteins. \r\nTo evaluate further the effect of elastin on the contractile phenotype in\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells, we examined the organization of vinculin,\r\ntubulin and desmin in Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells (Burridge\r\net al., 1996). Vinculin is concentrated in focal adhesion plaques\r\nthat bind the actin cytoskeleton and connect with the cell membrane. Indirect\r\nimmunofluorescent staining for vinculin revealed abundant focal adhesion\r\nplaques in 94% of Eln+/+ cells when scored by observers\r\nblinded to genotype (Fig.\r\n2F,J). By contrast, only 12% of Eln-/- cells\r\nhad a normal distribution of defined focal adhesion plaques\r\n(Fig. 2G,J). Within 3 hours of\r\nexposure to recombinant tropoelastin protein, the percentage of\r\nEln-/- cells with defined focal adhesions increased 6-fold\r\nto 79% (Fig. 2I,J). Treatment\r\nhad no effect on focal adhesion organization in Eln+/+\r\ncells (Fig. 2H,J).\r\nImmunostaining for other cytoskeletal proteins, tubulin\r\n(Fig. 2K,L) and desmin (data\r\nnot shown) showed no difference between Eln+/+', ' and\r\nEln-/- cells. Thus, the loss of elastin in vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells does not lead to a broad disruption of cytoskeletal architecture.\r\nThese results indicate that elastin induces a mature, contractile phenotype in\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells by regulating the organization of specific\r\ncytoskeletal proteins. \r\nElastin controls the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nVascular proliferative disease involves the migration of smooth muscle\r\ncells from the arterial media to the subendothelial space, forming a neointima\r\n(Schwartz, 1997). The same\r\nphenomenon is observed during the development of Eln-/-\r\narteries. We postulated that the elastin matrix surrounding each concentric\r\nlayer of vascular smooth muscle cells provides a cue that localizes these\r\ncells to the arterial media, and prevents their migration to the neointima. To\r\ntest this hypothesis, we used a modified Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay. We\r\ndiscovered that vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to tropoelastin in a\r\ndose-dependent manner (Fig.\r\n3A). Cell migration depended on the concentration gradient of\r\ntropoelastin, not the total amount used in the assay. Chemotaxis was minimal\r\nfor cells in control (0/0 ng/ml) and static fields of tropoelastin (200/200\r\nng/ml), but increased significantly as the concentration gradient of\r\ntropoelastin rose to 200 ng/ml. A similar but less dramatic effect was seen\r\nwith cells that produce elastin (Fig.\r\n3A), suggesting that the synthesis and secretion of elastin by\r\nEln+/+ cells reduced migration to external stimuli. These\r\ndata demonstrate that elastin is a potent chemoattractant for vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells. \r\nView larger version (18K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 3. Elastin controls migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. (A)\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells migrate to tropoelastin in a concentration-dependent manner,\r\nindicating that tropoelastin is a specific and direct stimulus for vascular', '\r\nsmooth muscle cell localization. In addition, Eln-/- cells\r\nconsistently migrated at a higher rate than Eln+/+ cells,\r\nsuggesting that the autocrine production of elastin by\r\nEln+/+ cells reduces their chemotaxis to external stimuli.\r\n(B) Tropoelastin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell migration to the\r\nchemotactic growth factor PDGF. A modified Boyden chamber assay was used for\r\nall experiments to determine the total number of migrated cells in 15 randomly\r\nselected high power microscope fields (HPF). Data shown are the\r\nmean±s.e.m. from three independent wells.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nCytokines and growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor\r\n(PDGF), are thought to mediate the subendothelial migration of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells in occlusive vascular lesions\r\n(Lusis, 2000;\r\nBornfeldt et al., 1993). To\r\ndetermine if elastin matrix deposited in the arterial media can counteract the\r\npotent chemotactic activity of PDGF, we repeated the Boyden chamber\r\nexperiments. At a PDGF concentration of 30 ng/ml, Eln-/-\r\ncells showed a fourfold increase in chemotactic activity\r\n(Fig. 3B). Increasing\r\nconcentrations of tropoelastin prevented Eln-/- cell\r\nmigration towards PDGF (Fig.\r\n3B). Similar results were observed in Eln+/+\r\ncells. These data suggest that elastin provides a local cue that prevents\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells from migrating away from the arterial media to\r\nthe subendothelial space. Together, these in vitro experiments demonstrate\r\nthat elastin is a potent and specific regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nmaturation, migration and proliferation. \r\nElastin signals via a non-integrin, G-protein coupled signaling\r\npathway\r\nTo determine whether elastin has a direct signaling effect, we examined the\r\nmolecular mechanism of the regulation by elastin of vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells. Though various binding proteins, chaperones and other matrix elements\r\nthat interact with elastin have been identified and cloned, the mechanism of\r\nelastin signaling remains', ' to be elucidated\r\n(Mecham and Hinek, 1986;\r\nHinek et al., 1988;\r\nMecham et al., 1991; Grosso et\r\nal., 1991b; Hinek, 1995;\r\nHinek, 1996;\r\nPrivitera et al., 1998). Using\r\nin vitro assays of migration and actin polymerization, we examined the\r\nsignaling cascade stimulated by elastin in Eln-/- vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells. Above, we demonstrate that elastin mediates actin\r\npolymerization through a Rho mediated signal transduction pathway\r\n(Fig. 2E). Cell-surface\r\nreceptors that are known to regulate the Rho signaling pathway include the\r\nintegrins and G-protein-coupled receptors\r\n(Seasholtz et al., 1999;\r\nWei et al., 2001). Integrins\r\nare a well-characterized family of receptors that recognize matrix proteins\r\nsuch as collagen, vitronectin, fibulin and fibronectin. Although elastin is\r\nnot a known ligand for integrins, recent work suggests that the integrins may\r\nbe involved in elastin signaling through an intermediary, fibulin 5\r\n(Nakamura et al., 2002;\r\nYanagisawa et al., 2002).\r\nFibulin 5 interacts directly with elastin, and serves as a ligand for\r\ncell-surface integrins. Integrins require extracellular divalent cations to\r\nbind their matrix ligands, and low doses of chelators such as EDTA block these\r\ncell-matrix interactions (Brockdorff et\r\nal., 1998). As expected, control experiments demonstrated that\r\nintegrin mediated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells to collagen was\r\nEDTA sensitive (Fig. 4A).\r\nHowever, EDTA did not interfere with tropoelastin-mediated migration or actin\r\npolymerization of Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 4A,B). In addition,\r\nblocking antibodies to integrins known to bind other matrix proteins such as\r\ncollagen and fibulin 5 did not perturb elastin-mediated actin polymerization\r\nor chemotaxis (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly suggest', ' that the\r\nintegrin family of receptors is not involved in elastin signaling. \r\nView larger version (31K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 4. Tropoelastin regulates migration and actin polymerization via a\r\nnon-integrin, G-protein-coupled signaling pathway. (A)\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to recombinant\r\ntropoelastin in an EDTA insensitive manner. By comparison, we show that\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell migration to collagen, which is mediated by\r\nintegrins, is EDTA sensitive. (B) Tropoelastin mediated actin polymerization\r\nof Eln-/- cells is EDTA insensitive. (C) Migration of\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells towards tropoelastin\r\nis pertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments with the B protomer of\r\npertussis toxin alone demonstrate that the effect of pertussis toxin is\r\nspecific to its ability to inhibit G-protein signaling. The migration of\r\nEln-/- cells to PDGF (30 ng/ml) is insensitive to\r\npertussis toxin. This control experiment demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- cells treated with pertussis toxin can respond\r\nnormally to stimuli other than tropoelastin. (D) Tropoelastin-mediated actin\r\npolymerization of Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells is\r\npertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments demonstrate that the B protomer\r\nof pertussis toxin does not inhibit actin polymerization. Together, these\r\nexperiments indicate that tropoelastin regulates vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nthrough a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein signaling pathway. (E) Cholera\r\ntoxin (ctxn) and forskolin (frskln) increase the baseline levels of cAMP in\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells by constitutive\r\nactivation of the Gs pathway. In the presence of tropoelastin and\r\nforskolin, there is a marked decrease in cAMP. A similar decrease in cAMP\r\nlevels is observed when tropoelastin is added to cholera toxin pretreated\r\ncells. The reduction in cAMP was blocked by', ' pertussis toxin and not B-protomer\r\nindicating a Gi specific pathway. These experiments indicate that\r\ntropoelastin activates a receptor that signals through Gi to\r\ninhibit adenylate cyclase, and reduce cAMP levels. (F) Tropoelastin activates\r\nRhoA in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments\r\ndemonstrate that tropoelastin treatment of Eln-/- cells\r\nresults in a marked elevation of activated RhoA. This response is pertussis\r\ntoxin sensitive and B-protomer insensitive indicating that tropoelastin\r\nactivation of the Rho pathway requires Gi activity. (G) Proposed\r\nmolecular mechanism for tropoelastin-mediated actin polymerization in vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are the largest family of transmembrane\r\nreceptors and are known to activate Rho kinase\r\n(Seasholtz et al., 1999;\r\nMarinissen and Gutkind, 2001).\r\nGPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins classified into four protein\r\nfamilies: Gs, Gi, Gq and G12/13\r\n(Marinissen and Gutkind,\r\n2001). Pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of Gi\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000), blocked\r\ntropoelastin-mediated migration and actin polymerization of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (Fig. 4C,D). The\r\nspecificity of pertussis toxin inhibition was demonstrated in a series of\r\ncontrol experiments. First, migration of vascular smooth muscle cells to\r\nplatelet-derived growth factor is not dependent on a G-protein-coupled\r\nsignaling pathway and was not disrupted by pertussis toxin\r\n(Fig. 4C). Second, pertussis\r\ntoxin is composed of two subunits, A and B\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000). The A\r\nprotomer inhibits Gi by ADP ribosylation, while the B protomer\r\nfacilitates the entry of the toxin into the cell. In the presence of B\r\nprotomer alone, there was no disruption of either migration or actin\r', '\npolymerization (Fig. 4C,D). Using a Ca2+-sensitive dye, fura-2, and immunoprecipitations with\r\nspecific antibodies, we detected no evidence that rapid Ca2+\r\ninflux, tyrosine kinase receptors or the Map kinase pathway was involved in\r\nelastin signaling (data not shown). Together, these experiments indicate that\r\nelastin signaling is mediated via a non-integrin and pertussis toxin-sensitive\r\nG-protein-coupled signaling pathway. \r\nThe pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, Gi, inhibits adenylate\r\ncyclase, the enzyme responsible for generating cAMP\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000). To\r\nobtain direct biochemical evidence that tropoelastin signals through\r\nGi, we measured the level of cAMP in tropoelastin-treated cells. To\r\nmeasure a reduction in cAMP level, it was necessary to increase the baseline\r\ncellular levels of cAMP using either forskolin or cholera toxin, agents that\r\nactivate adenylate cyclase (Thomas et al.,\r\n2000; Coward et al.,\r\n1999). When tropoelastin was added to either forskolin or cholera\r\ntoxin pretreated cells, the reduction in cAMP levels was between 40 and 60%,\r\nindicating that Gi was activated and inhibited adenylate cyclase\r\nactivity (Fig. 4E). These\r\nreductions in cAMP levels are comparable with those observed with other\r\nligands known to activate Gi via known G-protein-coupled receptors\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000;\r\nCoward et al., 1999). The\r\nreduction in cAMP was pertussis toxin sensitive, which confirmed the role of\r\nGi. Thus, tropoelastin activates Gi and reduces cAMP\r\nlevels. Finally, consistent with the activation of Gi, we found no evidence\r\nfor rapid Ca2+ influx, a prominent feature of Gq\r\nactivation, in our cellular system. Although GPCRs activate the Gi\r\npathway and ligands for many of these receptors have not been identified, our\r\ndata does not rule out the possibility that elastin might indirectly activate\r\nthe GPCR pathway at the level of the heterotrimeric G', ' proteins. \r\nOthers have shown that the GPCRs pathway can trigger the Rho signaling\r\ncascade (Seasholtz et al.,\r\n1999; Wei et al.,\r\n2001; Kabarowski et al.,\r\n2000). In this cascade, activated RhoA stimulates Rho kinase. We\r\nexamined whether tropoelastin stimulated the RhoA signaling pathway via\r\nactivation of a G-protein-coupled signaling pathway. Immunoprecipitation\r\nexperiments demonstrate that tropoelastin activates RhoA through a pertussis\r\ntoxin-sensitive mechanism (Fig.\r\n4F). Together, our pharmacological and biochemical data lead us to\r\npropose a molecular mechanism for elastin signaling\r\n(Fig. 4G). In vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells, elastin activates a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein-coupled\r\npathway that stimulates Gi, inhibits adenylate cyclase, reduces\r\ncAMP levels and stimulates Rho induced actin polymerization. In the absence of\r\nelastin synthesis, this mechanism is disrupted and vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells lose their contractile phenotype. Thus, there is a direct role for\r\nelastin in controlling vascular smooth muscle cells. \r\nElastin reduces the vascular proliferative response to arterial\r\ninjury in vivo\r\nThe in vitro experiments described above demonstrated that elastin is an\r\nautocrine factor that induces a contractile state, inhibits proliferation and\r\nlocalizes vascular smooth muscle cells to the vessel wall. These data suggest\r\nthat disruption of a crucial morphogenic signal in the vessel wall may release\r\nsmooth muscle cells to dedifferentiate, proliferate and occlude mature\r\narteries. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we used a porcine model to\r\ndetermine whether the application of exogenous elastin to a site of vascular\r\ninjury would reduce the neointimal accumulation of smooth muscle cells and\r\narterial stenosis. \r\nPorous sheaths of elastin matrix were generated from porcine carotid\r\narteries using established methods (Malone\r\net al., 1984). The purity of the elastin was confirmed by scanning\r\nelectron microscopy (Fig. 5A),\r\nimmunohistochemistry,', ' amino acid composition and desmosine content\r\n(Starcher, 1977) (data not\r\nshown). The amino acid composition and the concentration of the crosslinking\r\namino acids desmosine, isodesmosine and lysinonorleucine revealed no\r\nmicrofibrillar proteins or other impurities. Elastin sheaths were secured to\r\nintracoronary stents (Fig. 5B)\r\nand successfully deployed in porcine coronary arteries using standard\r\ncatheterization techniques. The biocompatibility of elastin sheaths was\r\nassessed 3 days and 14 days after placement in the porcine coronary artery.\r\nElastin sheaths did not evoke an inflammatory or thrombotic response (data not\r\nshown). Moreover, elastin sheaths were biologically stable and did not degrade\r\nwithin the arterial wall during the course of animal studies. These\r\nexperiments demonstrate that elastin sheaths can be used to restore elastin\r\nmatrix to sites of vascular injury. \r\nView larger version (80K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 5. Elastin therapy reduces vascular smooth muscle cell accumulation and\r\narterial obstruction in vivo. (A) Scanning electron micrographs of elastin\r\nsheaths. Scale bar: 10 µm. (B) Elastin matrix sheath covering an expanded\r\nmetal stent. (C,D) Representative cross-sections taken from control arteries\r\n(n=14) display the development of a thick fibrocellular neointima\r\n(C), whereas the neointima is substantially decreased in elastin sheath\r\n(arrows) treated arteries (n=13) with the same injury score (D).\r\n(E,F) Over a range of injury, the percent lumen stenosis (E) and mean\r\nneointimal thickness (F) were significantly reduced (both\r\nP<0.0001) in injured porcine coronary arteries treated with\r\nelastin sheath-stents compared with control stents.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo determine if elastin sheaths would reduce vascular smooth muscle\r\naccumulation and neointimal formation, we used an established porcine coronary\r\ninjury model of', ' in-stent restenosis\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1992;\r\nSchwartz et al., 1994). Two\r\nmajor coronary arteries of domestic pigs received either a control stent or an\r\nelastin sheath-covered stent following vascular injury caused by balloon\r\noverexpansion. Four weeks after injury and stent placement, representative\r\ncross-sections taken from control arteries displayed a thick fibrocellular\r\nneointima (Fig. 5C). By\r\ncontrast, neointimal formation was substantially reduced in elastin\r\nsheath-treated arteries (Fig.\r\n5D). Standard measurements of mean neointimal thickness (NIT) and\r\npercent stenosis were measured and correlated with the degree of injury\r\ninduced by stent placement. The well-established correlation between the\r\nseverity of injury and the amount of neointimal accumulation\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1994) is\r\nreproduced in our experiments with the control stents. Throughout the range of\r\ninjury scores, there is a significant reduction in the NIT and percent\r\nstenosis in elastin sheath-treated arteries, with the greatest benefit at the\r\nhighest injury scores (Fig.\r\n5E,F). At a mean injury score of 2, when stent placement disrupts\r\ninternal elastic lamella and lacerates the arterial media, elastin sheaths\r\nreduced the mean neointimal thickness by 52% as compared with controls. The\r\nspecificity of the effect of elastin as a stent coating is supported by the\r\nwork of our group and others with non-elastin sheaths. Sheaths made from\r\ncollagen, fibrin or synthetic biopolymers failed to reduce neointimal\r\nthickness compared with bare stents and were frequently associated with a\r\nworse outcome (Goodwin et al.,\r\n2000; McKenna et al.,\r\n1998; van der Giessen et al.,\r\n1996; van Beusekom et al.,\r\n1998). Thus, consistent with the in vitro results, our in vivo\r\nexperiments indicate that restoration of elastin matrix to a site of injury\r\nreduces vascular smooth muscle accumulation and limits neointimal\r\nformation. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTOP', '\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nElastin is a critical regulatory molecule within the arterial\r\nwall\r\nWe conclude that elastin is a critical regulatory molecule that controls\r\nthe phenotypic modulation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells. This conclusion is based on the following observations. First,\r\ncells that lack elastin proliferate at a rate twofold greater than wild-type\r\ncells. Second, cells that lack elastin fail to form a mature contractile\r\nphenotype, which is characteristic of wild-type cells. Third, cells that lack\r\nelastin migrate more aggressively to an exogenous chemoattractant than\r\nwild-type cells. Fourth, all of these aberrant phenotypes induced by the\r\nabsence of elastin can be rescued in vitro by the addition of recombinant\r\ntropoelastin. Fifth, elastin exerts its regulatory function on vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells by activating a G-protein coupled signaling pathway. Finally,\r\nrestoring elastin to a site of vascular injury in vivo reduces the neointimal\r\naccumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, elastin matrix deposited\r\nby vascular smooth muscle cells in the arterial media provides a local cue\r\nthat regulates these cells in vitro and in vivo. \r\nElastin-VSMC signaling is a critical morphogenic signal that is\r\ndisrupted during the pathogenesis of vascular disease\r\nVascular smooth muscle cells are able to exist in a quiescent contractile\r\nstate or a proliferative non-contractile state\r\n(Raines and Ross, 1993;\r\nOwens, 1998). This plasticity\r\nenables the vascular system to regenerate and grow. However, plasticity must\r\nbe balanced by the need to maintain a mature and stable structure capable of\r\ncirculating blood throughout a whole animal. Because vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells modulate their phenotype readily, external factors must instruct them to\r\nremain in a mature state if homeostasis is to be achieved. Our data indicate\r\nthat the elastin matrix is a potent autocrine factor that regulates arterial\r\nmorphogenesis by instructing vascular smooth muscle cells to', ' localize around\r\nthe elastic fibers in organized rings and remain in a quiescent, contractile\r\nstate (Fig. 6A). This\r\ncell-matrix interaction is mediated via a heterotrimeric G-protein signaling\r\npathway that activates downstream rho GTPases and appears to be crucial for\r\nstabilizing and maintaining the structure of the mature artery. When this\r\nmorphogenic signal is absent during arterial development, the unregulated\r\nmigration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells results in\r\nocclusion of the arterial lumen (Li et\r\nal., 1998) (Fig.\r\n6B). This leads us to propose that focal disruption or destruction\r\nof the elastin matrix in the mature artery by factors such as mechanical\r\ninjury or inflammation play an important and direct role in the fibrocellular\r\nresponse characteristic of proliferative vascular diseases\r\n(Fig. 6C). Previously, emphasis\r\nwas placed on the pivotal role of inflammatory cells in regulating vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors\r\n(Lusis, 2000;\r\nRoss, 1995). In our model, the\r\ndegradation of elastin by macrophages, T-cells and their proteases acts to\r\nrelease vascular smooth muscle cells from their mature contractile state to\r\nmigrate, proliferate and form a neointima. Thus, the disruption of an\r\nessential morphogenic signal contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular\r\ndisease. \r\nView larger version (37K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 6. Model of elastin-vascular smooth muscle cell interactions in development\r\nand disease. (A) During normal development, vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nsynthesize and secrete elastin polymers that form concentric rings of elastic\r\nlamellae around the arterial lumen. Elastin provides mechanical support to the\r\nvessel wall, and signals vascular smooth muscle cells to localize around the\r\nelastic lamellae and remain in a quiescent, contractile state. (B) In the\r\nabsence of elastin, this morphogenic signal is lost resulting in pervasive\r\nsubendothelial migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nthat occludes the', ' vascular lumen. (C) This leads us to propose that the focal\r\ndisruption and/or destruction of elastin in the mature artery by vascular\r\ninjury releases smooth muscle cells to dedifferentiate, migrate and\r\nproliferate, and contributes to neointimal formation.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nFour lines of evidence support our model of elastin-vascular smooth muscle\r\nsignaling in the pathogenesis of vascular proliferative diseases. \r\nPathology\r\nDisruption of elastin matrix is consistently associated with vascular\r\nproliferative diseases in human pathological specimens\r\n(Sandberg et al., 1981;\r\nSims, 2000;\r\nSims et al., 1989). Moreover,\r\nthe severity of occlusive vascular pathology increases in proportion to the\r\nmagnitude of defects and discontinuities in the elastin matrix\r\n(Sims et al., 1989). It has\r\nalso been noted that the programmed intimal hyperplasia and arterial occlusion\r\nrequired for the closure of the ductus arteriosis is associated with impaired\r\nelastic fiber formation (Hinek et al.,\r\n1991). \r\nGenetic\r\nWe previously showed in human genetic studies that loss-of-function\r\nmutations in elastin is sufficient to cause a human vascular proliferative\r\ndisease, supravalvular aortic stenosis and Williams-Beuren syndrome\r\n(Li et al., 1997;\r\nCurran et al., 1993; Ewart,\r\n1993). In these diseases, there is an aggressive occlusive pathology that\r\ndevelops throughout the arterial tree of affected children in the absence of\r\ncommon risk factors for vascular disease. \r\nExperimental\r\nIn murine gene-targeting experiments, we demonstrated that loss of elastin\r\nis sufficient to cause occlusive vascular pathology\r\n(Li et al., 1998). This\r\npathology was caused by the unregulated proliferation, migration and\r\naccumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the subendothelial space\r\n(Fig. 6B). In this model,\r\nsevere arterial obstruction occurs in the absence of an inflammatory response\r\nor hemodynamic stress. \r\nTherapeutic\r\nIn this manuscript, we show that exogenous tropoelastin can control the\r\nprol', 'iferation, migration and maturation of vascular smooth muscle cells in\r\nvitro, and reduce the development of fibrocellular pathology in vivo. Other\r\ninvestigators have shown that matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, which\r\nprevent the degradation of matrix components, can reduce neointimal formation\r\n(Zaidi et al., 2000).\r\nTogether, these data indicate that the destruction of the elastin matrix is a\r\ncritical step in the fibrocellular response characteristic of vascular\r\nproliferative disorders. Although strongly indicative, definitive proof of a\r\nrole for elastin signaling in a vascular proliferative response requires\r\nfurther studies. \r\nElastin is unique among vascular extracellular matrix proteins\r\nThe extracellular matrix is known to play a crucial function in the\r\nregulation of vascular smooth muscle cell biology. The myriad associations and\r\ninteraction between the many structural proteins, proteoglycans and growth\r\nfactors of the vascular matrix makes it difficult to distinguish the effects\r\nof each element from one another. However, numerous in vitro studies have\r\ndemonstrated the ability of matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin and\r\nlaminin to affect vascular smooth muscle cell activity, including phenotypic\r\nmodulation, migration and proliferation\r\n(Raines, 2000;\r\nHedin et al., 1999). These\r\ndata might suggest that there is overlap and redundancy with regard to the\r\nfunction of different vascular matrix proteins. Elastin, however, is unique\r\namong matrix elements in that the disruption of this gene leads to a vascular\r\nproliferative pathology in human and animal models. Disruption of other genes\r\nencoding vascular matrix proteins, including fibulin, fibrillin and collagen\r\nis associated with either arterial tortuosity, dissection or aneurysm\r\nformation in vivo, not proliferative or occlusive vascular pathology\r\n(Nakamura et al., 2002;\r\nYanagisawa et al., 2002;\r\nArteaga-Solis et al., 2000;\r\nDietz and Mecham, 2000).\r\nMoreover, the specificity of the effect of elastin in vivo is supported by\r\nstudies showing that collagen matrix-covered stents do not reduce neointimal\r\nformation in a porcine model of restenosis\r\n', '(Goodwin et al., 2000). Thus,\r\nelastin, when compared with other matrix proteins, is effective in both in\r\nvitro and in vivo experimental models. From these studies one would expect\r\nthat targeted disruption of the elastin signaling mechanism would replicate\r\nphenotypes observed in Eln-/- cell and mice. \r\nRestoration of elastin for the treatment of proliferative vascular\r\ndiseases\r\nOur work suggests that understanding the link between vascular development\r\nand disease may provide an alternative and potentially complementary strategy\r\nfor the treatment of vascular proliferative diseases. Previously, emphasis has\r\nbeen placed on improving the outcome of vascular disease by inhibiting smooth\r\nmuscle cell proliferation with coronary stents coated with either\r\nradioactivity or chemotherapeutic drugs such as rapamycin, actinomycin D and\r\npaclitaxil (Heldman et al.,\r\n2001; Leon et al.,\r\n2001; Sousa et al.,\r\n2001). These treatments use a common strategy of disrupting\r\nfundamental pathways such as microtubule assembly, DNA stability, and\r\nregulatory cell cycle proteins that are required in virtually all actively\r\ndividing cells. We present work that suggests restoring a natural morphogenic\r\nsignal to the vessel wall may also be therapeutically beneficial. Clearly,\r\nadditional work is needed to verify that results with murine and porcine\r\nmodels are recapitulated in humans. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\xa0\r\nWe thank Bob Mecham for assistance with synthesizing recombinant\r\ntropoelastin, confirming the purity of the elastin sheath and recombinant\r\ntropoelastin, providing the polyclonal murine tropoelastin antibody, and\r\ndiscussions; Roy Biran (Keck Center for Tissue Engineering) for antibodies and\r\nhelp with fluorescent imaging; and Mary Scriven for assistance in generating\r\nmanuscript figures.

This fibrocellular response has largely been\r\nattributed to the release of multiple cytokines and growth factors by\r\ninflammatory cells. Previously, we demonstrated that the disruption of the\r\nel', 'astin matrix leads to defective arterial morphogenesis. Here, we propose\r\nthat elastin is a potent autocrine regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nactivity and that this regulation is important for preventing fibrocellular\r\npathology. Using vascular smooth muscle cells from mice lacking elastin\r\n(Eln-/-), we show that elastin induces actin stress fiber\r\norganization, inhibits proliferation, regulates migration and signals via a\r\nnon-integrin, heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled pathway. In a porcine coronary\r\nmodel of restenosis, the therapeutic delivery of exogenous elastin to injured\r\nvessels in vivo significantly reduces neointimal formation. These findings\r\nindicate that elastin stabilizes the arterial structure by inducing a\r\nquiescent contractile state in vascular smooth muscle cells. Together, this\r\nwork demonstrates that signaling pathways crucial for arterial morphogenesis\r\ncan play an important role in the pathogenesis and treatment of vascular\r\ndisease. \r\nKey words: Elastin matrix, Vascular smooth muscle, Morphogenesis, G-protein signaling, Vascular proliferative diseases\r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nVascular proliferative diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that\r\ninclude atherosclerosis, coronary restenosis, bypass-graft failure and\r\ntransplant arteriopathy that lead to arterial narrowing, restriction of blood\r\nflow and tissue ischemia. These diseases arise from a complex\r\npathophysiological response to injury by multiple factors, including\r\nhypercholesterolemia, diabetes, smoking, hypertension and mechanical injury\r\n(Ross, 1995;\r\nLusis, 2000). Although their\r\netiologies are diverse, these disorders all share a common pathological\r\nfeature: the accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells and fibrous\r\nconnective tissue within the intima between the endothelium and medial layer\r\nof the vessel wall (Lusis,\r\n2000; Raines and Ross,\r\n1993). This fibrocellular pathology, known as neointimal\r\nformation, results from the activation, proliferation and migration', ' of\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (Raines and\r\nRoss, 1993; Schwartz,\r\n1997). Understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell regulation is crucial for developing strategies to\r\nprevent and treat vascular proliferative disorders. \r\n \r\nVascular smooth muscle cells are not terminally differentiated and can\r\nalternate between a quiescent, contractile state and a proliferative\r\nnon-contractile state (Raines and Ross,\r\n1993; Owens, 1998;\r\nThyberg, 1998). In a healthy\r\nartery, vascular smooth muscle cells are quiescent and largely comprise a\r\ncontractile apparatus that functions to dilate and constrict the lumen as\r\nrequired by physiological demands. Actin stress fibers serve as the scaffold\r\nfor the contractile apparatus, and are a hallmark of mature and quiescent\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (Burridge and\r\nChrzanowska-Wodnicka, 1996;\r\nSmall and Gimona, 1998). Under\r\ncircumstances of injury, repair and regeneration, vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nlose their contractile apparatus and dedifferentiate into an immature\r\nphenotype capable of proliferating and depositing extracellular matrix\r\n(Owens, 1998;\r\nThyberg, 1998). This\r\nfibrocellular response plays an important role in all forms of vascular\r\nproliferative diseases. In atherosclerotic lesions, the major components of\r\nthe fibrous plaque are vascular smooth muscle cells, the matrix products\r\ndeposited by these cells, and extracellular cholesterol\r\n(Ross, 1995;\r\nLusis, 2000;\r\nRaines and Ross, 1993). In\r\nrestenosis, transplant arteriopathy and vascular graft disease; smooth muscle\r\ncells are the predominant component of the occlusive lesion\r\n(Raines and Ross, 1993). The\r\nphenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells offers a tempting target\r\nfor preventing vascular proliferative diseases. \r\nElastin is the dominant extracellular matrix protein deposited in the\r\narterial wall and can contribute up to 50% of its dry weight\r\n(Parks et al., 1993). The\r\nprotein product of the elastin gene is synthesized by vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells', ' and secreted as a monomer, tropoelastin. After post-translational\r\nmodification, tropoelastin is crosslinked and organized into elastin polymers\r\nthat form concentric rings of elastic lamellae around the arterial lumen. Each\r\nelastic lamella alternates with a ring of smooth muscle, and provides the\r\ncompliance that arteries need to absorb and transmit hemodynamic force\r\n(Wolinski et al., 1967). There\r\nis a growing body of evidence that implicates elastin in vascular development\r\nand disease. We previously demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations of one\r\nelastin allele cause supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and Williams-Beuren\r\nSyndrome (Li et al., 1997;\r\nCurran et al., 1993;\r\nEwart et al., 1993). These\r\ndisorders are characterized by discrete fibrocellular stenoses in the aorta,\r\ncoronary arteries, carotid arteries, pulmonary arteries and other peripheral\r\narteries. Often, individuals with these diseases are young children who are\r\nsusceptible to peripheral vascular disease, myocardial infarctions or stroke\r\nin the absence of other risk factors such as high serum cholesterol, diabetes\r\nand cigarette smoking (van Son et al.,\r\n1994). In subsequent experiments, we showed that the deposition of\r\nelastin matrix in the arterial wall during late fetal development is essential\r\nto arterial morphogenesis (Li et al.,\r\n1998). Mice that lack elastin (Eln-/-) died\r\nfrom occlusive fibrocellular pathology caused by subendothelial proliferation\r\nand accumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in early neonatal life. In\r\nEln-/- vessels, there is no evidence of abnormal\r\nendothelial structure, activation or proliferation. Furthermore, the occlusive\r\nvascular phenotype occurred in the absence of hemodynamic stress and\r\ninflammation. This work demonstrated that elastin is required for arterial\r\ndevelopment. However, because the absence of elastin undoubtedly distorts the\r\npresentation and stability of other important elements of the matrix\r\narchitecture, these studies failed to define the specific role for elastin in\r\nestablishing and maintaining a mature artery. \r', ""\nHere we show that elastin regulates the phenotypic modulation,\r\nproliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells in culture. We\r\nconfirm a direct signaling effect by demonstrating that elastin regulates\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells via a G-protein-coupled signaling pathway.\r\nFinally, we establish that in vivo, exogenous elastin reduces the vascular\r\nproliferative response of an injured artery. These results demonstrate that\r\nelastin is a crucial signaling molecule that directly controls vascular smooth\r\nmuscle biology and stabilizes arterial structure. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nIsolation of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nNewborn (postnatal day 0.5) Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- pups were sacrificed by CO2\r\nasphyxiation. Their ascending aortas were dissected free, endothelium removed\r\nand placed into individual wells of a plastic 12-well culture dish containing\r\nAmniomax C-100 growth medium (Gibco-BRL) supplemented with\r\npenicillin/streptomycin. Cultures of smooth muscle cells that formed around\r\nthe tissue were trypsinized (0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mM EDTA), passaged, expanded\r\nand genotyped to confirm their identity. Cells were stained with SM\r\n-actin (Clone 1A4, Sigma) and checked for classic `hill-and-valley'\r\nmorphology to confirm their smooth muscle status. In situ hybridization,\r\nimmunostaining and RT/PCR analysis established that these cells expressed the\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell markers SM -actin, SM -actin, SM-22,\r\ncalponin, desmin, ang-1/ang-2, and did not express the endothelial markers\r\nFlk-1 or Flt-1. \r\nCellular assays\r\nCellular experiments of proliferation, actin polymerization and migration\r\ndescribed below were performed on at least three independently isolated\r\nprimary cell lines. Proliferation was assayed by"", ' cell count and\r\n[3H]thymidine incorporation. Confluent cultures of\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells from the fourth passage were seeded at a density of\r\n2x103 cells/well on a plastic 24-well plate (Corning Costar,\r\nCorning, NY), and stimulated to proliferate in AmnioMAX C-100 growth medium\r\n(Gibco-BRL) treated with 100 µg/ml recombinant tropoelastin or left\r\nuntreated. Cell numbers for each culture were assayed by hemocytometer after\r\n24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. For [3H]thymidine incorporation,\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- cells were seeded at\r\na density of 20,000 cells/well on a 24-well plate. After attachment, cells\r\nwere starved in 0.1% BSA (Fisher) in Amniomax Basal Medium (Gibco) for 24\r\nhours. Cells were then grown in whole Amniomax medium treated/untreated with\r\n100 µg/ml tropoelastin (Grosso et al., 1991a). Cells were assayed for\r\n[3H]thymidine incorporation using a scintillation counter after 24\r\nhours by precipitating with 5% TCA, followed by NaOH solubilization. Data were\r\ncalculated as mean±s.d. (n=6). \r\nSubconfluent cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells were evaluated and\r\nscored for the presence of actin stress fibers in the cytoplasm following\r\nimmunofluorescent staining for SM -actin (Clone 1A4, Sigma), vinculin\r\n(Clone hVin-1, Sigma), desmin (Sigma) and tubulin (Clone DM-1A, Calbiochem).\r\nCells were treated with tropoelastin (1 µg/ml) (Grosso et al., 1991a) or\r\nnot, and assays were performed in serum-free media. Cells were scored as\r\ncontractile if they had distinct actin stress fibers continuous throughout the\r\ncytoplasm, or at least 10 well-defined focal adhesions distributed throughout\r\nthe cytoplasm and cell', ' periphery. Scoring was performed by three separate\r\nobservers blinded to the cell genotypes, and their numbers averaged. At least\r\n100 cells were scored in three separate cultures for each genotype.\r\nAdditionally, identical results were obtained for cells cultured on glass\r\nslides, 24 plastic tissue culture plates (Corning) coated with matrigel, and\r\nanother brand of plasticware (Falcon). \r\nThe chemotactic activity of cells was assayed in a modification of the\r\nBoyden chamber method using 6.5 mm transwell polycarbonate chemotaxis filter\r\ninserts in a plastic 24-well tissue culture plate (Corning Costar, Corning,\r\nNY). Various concentrations of recombinant tropoelastin (Grosso et al., 1991a)\r\nwere placed in both the upper or lower compartment and covered with a\r\npolycarbonate membrane filter (8 µm porosity). PDGF-BB (30 ng/ml) was added\r\nto the lower chamber and served as a positive control. Medium alone was used\r\nas the negative control. Cells to be tested were placed in the upper wells of\r\nthe chamber and incubated at 37°C/5% CO2 for 3 hours. After\r\nincubation, the cells adhering to the upper surface of the filter were scraped\r\noff and the cells that had migrated to the lower surface were fixed with 10%\r\nbuffered formalin, stained with DAPI (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and viewed\r\nunder a mercury lamp. Fifteen randomly selected high power (x200) fields\r\nwere counted on each filter by observers blinded to their conditions.\r\nChemotactic response was measured as the number of cells that had transversed\r\nthe filter in response to tropoelastin, PDGF and collagen type I (10\r\nµg/ml), and expressed as fold increase over baseline. Each condition was\r\nassayed in triplicate wells and each experiment was repeated at least three\r\ntimes. Actin polymerization and migration assays experiments were also\r\nperformed in triplicate in the presence of 100 µM Actinomycin D\r\n(Calbiochem), 10 µg/ml Cycloheximide (Calbiochem), 20 µM Y27632\r\n(Welfide), 20 µM ED', 'TA, 100 ng/ml Ptxn (Calbiochem) or 100 ng/ml B-protomer\r\n(Calbiochem). \r\nMeasurement of cAMP and activated Rho A\r\nAll biochemical measurements were performed in cells that were serum\r\nstarved overnight. cAMP assay levels were detected using an RIA kit (RPA538,\r\nAmersham Pharmacia). Briefly, cells were plated at a density of 80,000 to\r\n100,000 cells on a plastic 12-well cell-culture plate, pretreated with 100\r\nng/ml cholera toxin (Calbiochem) for 3 hours, treated with 1 µg/ml\r\nrecombinant tropoelastin for 20 minutes, and cAMP subsequently isolated.\r\nExperimental cAMP levels were quantified through use of a standard curve where\r\nknown amounts of cAMP were added to radioimmunoassay. \r\nRhoA-GTP was detected using a Rho Activation Kit (Upstate Biotechnology).\r\nBriefly, Eln-/- cells were grown to 70% confluence in a\r\nsix-well plate, and pretreated with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin or 100 ng/ml\r\nB-protomer for 3 hours. Control experiments with no pretreatment were also\r\nperformed. Cells were then treated with 1 µg/ml recombinant tropoelastin\r\nfor 3 hours and activated Rho A was isolated by immunoprecipitations with\r\nRhotekin coated beads. RhoA-GTP was detected by western blot analysis after\r\nsamples were run on a 10% acryllamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose\r\nmembranes. Equal amounts of total cellular lysate were run out for each sample\r\nto ensure that equivalent amounts of protein were used in all experiments. \r\nPorcine coronary model of in-stent restenosis\r\nElastin sheaths were prepared from dissected common carotid arteries of\r\nadult domestic swine (40 to 60 kg) using a variation of a previously published\r\nprotocol (Malone et al.,\r\n1984). Briefly, these vessels were sequentially treated with a 1%\r\nSDS solution supplemented with doxycycline (10 mg/l) and EDTA (5 mM),', '\r\npotassium hydroxide (5 N) at 60°C, collagenase solution (0.5 mg/ml,\r\nCollagenase D, Roche), autoclaved and  irradiated. The product of these\r\nextractions, a tubular elastin matrix sheath, was cut to size and fitted over\r\n14 mm long stainless steel expandable stents (Medtronic AVE, S670) mounted on\r\n3.5 mm diameter angioplasty balloons and secured by a metal coil. Control\r\nstents deployed were identical to elastin covered stents except for the\r\nabsence of elastin sheaths. \r\nNineteen domestic pigs (30 to 40 kg) on a normal diet were pretreated with\r\noral aspirin (625 mg), ticlopidine (250 mg) and verapamil (120 mg), and placed\r\nunder general anesthesia. Animals underwent placement of 32 stents in the left\r\nanterior descending, circumflex or right coronary artery. The methods of stent\r\nimplantation have been previously described\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1994).\r\nBriefly, control stents or elastin sheath-covered stents were advanced under\r\nfluoroscopic guidance to an appropriate site in the coronary vasculature and\r\ndeployed at a 1.2:1 to 1.4:1 stent-to-artery ratio compared with the baseline\r\nvessel diameter. After the procedure, the wounds were closed and the pigs were\r\nreturned to their quarters on a normal diet. Pigs were sacrificed at day 3\r\n(elastin-covered stent, n=2) and day 14 (elastin-covered stent,\r\nn=2) to assess biocompatibility of the elastin sheath. To study\r\nneointima formation, pigs were sacrificed at day 28 (control stents,\r\nn=15; elastin-covered stents, n=14) and instrumented\r\narteries were removed. Coronary arteries were fixed by pressure perfusion (100\r\nmm Hg) with 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours, dissected free, washed,\r\ndehydrated through graded alcohols and infiltrated with methylmethacrylate\r\n(MMA) at 4°C. After polymerization,', ' embedded specimens were\r\ncross-sectioned at 5 µm thickness using a tungsten-carbide microtome blade.\r\nEach arterial segment was stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin and elastic Van\r\nGieson stains. Three cross-sections taken from the two ends and the middle of\r\neach artery were used for histomorphometric analysis. Histological examination\r\nconfirmed that the elastin sheaths were retained in the arterial wall of all\r\nspecimens. \r\nHistomorphometric analysis\r\nMean neointimal thickness, percent stenosis and mean injury score were\r\nmeasured on Van Gieson-stained sections using calibrated digital microscopic\r\nplanimetry as previously described\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1992;\r\nSchwartz et al., 1994).\r\nBriefly, the mean neointimal thickness was measured by drawing a radial line\r\nfrom the lumen border to the point maximum penetration for each stent strut,\r\nand averaging the measurements. Percent area stenosis was calculated as %\r\nstenosis=100 x [1-(stenotic lumen area/original lumen area)]. The\r\noriginal lumen area was measured as the area subtended within the internal\r\nelastic lamina. The injury score measures the physical penetration of the\r\nstent strut into the vessel wall and was calculated using a graded scale from\r\n0-3 as previously described (Schwartz et\r\nal., 1992). Briefly, a score of 1 indicated that only the internal\r\nelastic lamina was lacerated; a score of 2 indicated laceration of the\r\narterial media; and a score of 3 indicated that the external elastic lamina\r\nwas lacerated. The mean injury score for each histological section was\r\ncalculated as mean injury score= injury scores for every strut/number\r\nof struts present per section. \r\nStatistics\r\nFor all in vitro experiments, mean and standard deviations were calculated\r\nand statistical analysis were carried out by analysis of variance (ANOVA). For\r\nin vivo experiments, statistical analysis was performed on injury score,\r\naverage neointimal thickness and percent lumen stenosis using regression\r\nmodeling (Schwartz et al.,\r\n1994). Linear regression modeling accounts for injury (a strong\r\ncovariate) and the injury-dependent ne', 'ointimal thickening between control\r\narteries and elastin treated arteries. Three models were used to establish\r\nwhether there were: (1) differences in intercepts, (2) differences in slopes\r\nallowing any intercept or (3) differences in slopes when the intercepts are\r\nfixed. Differences between the elastin sheath-stent and control stent at each\r\ninjury level were analyzed using the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons\r\nt test for all three regression models. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nRESULTS\r\nTOP\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nElastin inhibits the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells\r\nInvestigating the role of elastin in regulating vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells is confounded by the fact that these cells synthesize and secrete\r\nelastin. Thus, to determine the role of elastin in regulating cellular\r\nproliferation, differentiation and migration, we isolated vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells from mice lacking elastin (Eln-/-) and from\r\nwild-type sibling control animals (Eln+/+).\r\nImmunofluorescent staining and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction\r\n(RT-PCR) analyses established that Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells expressed and synthesized elastin (antibody to murine elastin\r\nkindly provided by Dr Robert Mecham, Washington University), whereas\r\nEln-/- cells did not\r\n(Fig. 1A-C). \r\nView larger version (64K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 1. Elastin inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. (A) RT-PCR\r\nexperiments confirm that murine vascular smooth muscle cells lines express\r\ncell specific markers. The elastin gene product is detected in\r\nEln+/+ and not Eln-/- cells.\r\nImmunofluorescence analysis with elastin antibodies and accompanying phase\r\nphotomicrographs demonstrate that Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (B) synthesize and secrete elastin matrix, whereas\r\nEln', '-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (C) do not produce\r\nelastin. (D) Assay measuring cell numbers demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate at a much\r\nhigher rate than do Eln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(P<0.0001, ANOVA). This difference is eliminated by the addition\r\nof recombinant elastin gene product or tropoelastin (tEln). (E) Assay\r\nmeasuring [3H]thymidine incorporation assay demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate at a rate\r\nover twofold greater than that for Eln+/+ cells. This\r\ndifference is eliminated by the inhibition of Eln-/- cells\r\nproliferation by tropoelastin (P<0.0001, ANOVA).\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo evaluate the role of elastin in vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nproliferation, we compared the growth rate of Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells. Cells were seeded at the same density and\r\ngrowth rates were assayed by counting cells after 24, 48 and 72 hours. The\r\nnumber of Eln-/- cells was greater than\r\nEln+/+ cells at all time points, and was increased over\r\ntwofold at 72 hours (Fig. 1D).\r\nThese data indicate that in the absence of elastin synthesis, vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells proliferate at an increased rate. \r\nTo prove the specificity of the effect of elastin on vascular smooth muscle\r\ncell growth, we tested whether adding exogenous recombinant tropoelastin to\r\nthe culture media inhibits cellular proliferation. Recombinant tropoelastin\r\nwas synthesized using a bacterial expression system (Grosso et al., 1991a) and\r\ndetermined to be pure by gel electrophoresis and amino acid composition.\r\nTropoelastin had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on proliferation, with a\r\nmaximal effect at 100 µg/ml (Fig.\r\n1D; data not shown). At this dose, the number of\r\nEln-/- cells was nearly identical to\r\nEln+/+ cells at 72 hours. At each time point, more than\r\n98% of all cells were viable as determined by Try', 'pan Blue staining, indicating\r\nthat tropoelastin was not cytotoxic. Similar results were observed when acid\r\nhydrolyzed elastic fibers,  elastin, were used for this assay. The\r\nresponses of Eln+/+ and Eln-/-\r\ncellular proliferation to tropoelastin\r\n(Fig. 1E) and  elastin\r\n(data not shown) were reproduced in [3H]thymidine incorporation\r\nassays. By comparison, there was no significant inhibitory effect on\r\nproliferation when Eln-/- cells were treated with type I\r\ncollagen (100 µg/ml) (data not shown). These data demonstrate that elastin\r\nregulates vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation. \r\nElastin induces a mature contractile phenotype in vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells\r\nThe primary function of mature differentiated vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nis contraction. This ability requires highly organized actin myofilaments,\r\noften referred to as actin stress fibers\r\n(Burridge et al., 1996;\r\nSmall and Gimona, 1998). To\r\ndetermine if elastin modulates the phenotype of vascular smooth muscle cells,\r\nwe evaluated actin organization in Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells using direct immunofluorescent staining with\r\nFITC-conjugated SM -actin antisera. Well-defined actin myofilaments\r\nwere apparent in more than 95% of Eln+/+ cells scored by\r\nobservers blinded to genotype (Fig.\r\n2A,E). By contrast, only 23% of Eln-/- cells\r\nhad actin stress fibers (Fig.\r\n2B,E). Furthermore, Eln-/- cells with actin\r\nstress fibers were qualitatively different than Eln+/+\r\ncells, with a distinctive, rounder morphology (data not shown). These data\r\nindicate that vascular smooth muscle cells lacking elastin fail to organize\r\ntheir contractile apparatus. \r\nView larger version (57K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 2. Elastin induces a mature contractile phenotype in vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells. (A-E) Immunofluorescence analysis for SM -', 'actin reveals that\r\nEln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells (A) have a highly\r\norganized network of actin stress fibers, a hallmark of mature contractile\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells. By contrast, there is a paucity of actin stress\r\nfibers in Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (B; outlined\r\nby white dots). The elastin gene product, recombinant tropoelastin, induces\r\nthe formation of organized actin stress fibers in Eln-/-\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells (D), but does not affect\r\nEln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells (C). Scoring analysis\r\ndemonstrates a significant increase in the percentage of\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells with organized actin\r\nmyofilaments after elastin treatment (P<0.0001) (E). Tropoelastin\r\nmediated actin polymerization is unaffected when Eln-/-\r\ncells are treated with either a gene transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D,\r\nor a protein translation inhibitor, cycloheximide. The Rho kinase inhibitor,\r\nY27632, blocks actin polymerization of tropoelastin treated\r\nEln-/- cells. (F-J) Immunofluorescence analysis for\r\nvinculin reveals that Eln+/+ vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(F) have well-defined focal adhesions (arrowheads). By contrast,\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (G; outlined by white\r\ndots) have poorly defined focal adhesions. Tropoelastin induces well-defined\r\nfocal adhesions (arrows) throughout Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (I), but does not affect Eln+/+ vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells (H). Scoring analysis revealed a significant increase\r\n(P<0.0001) in the percentage of Eln-/-\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells with defined focal adhesions after tropoelastin\r\ntreatment (J). (K,L) Immunofluorescence staining with antisera against tubulin\r\nreveals no difference between Eln+/+ vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (K) and Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells\r\n(L). Exposure times for all images are the same.', ' Results represent the\r\nmean±s.d. from three individual experiments.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo confirm that the failure to form an organized contractile apparatus in\r\nEln-/- cells resulted from the inability to synthesize and\r\nsecrete elastin, we treated these cells with recombinant tropoelastin protein.\r\nWithin 3 hours of exposure to tropoelastin, the percentage of\r\nEln-/- cells with organized actin stress fibers increased\r\nthreefold to 74% (Fig. 2D,E).\r\nThis response was does dependent and was also seen by phallodin staining for\r\nF-actin (data not shown). By comparison, tropoelastin treatment had not effect\r\non actin stress fiber organization in Eln+/+ cells\r\n(Fig. 2C,E). Similar results\r\nwere observed when Eln-/- cells were treated with\r\ncrosslinked  elastin (data not shown). However, no change in actin\r\nstress fiber organization was observed when Eln-/- cells\r\nwere treated with an equivalent concentration of type I collagen. In addition,\r\nthe induction of actin polymerization by tropoelastin was unaffected by the\r\npresence or absence of serum in culture (data not shown). Thus, extracellular\r\nelastin is an important mediator of actin polymerization and contractile\r\napparatus organization in vascular smooth muscle cells. \r\nThe Rho signal transduction pathway is known to be a central converging\r\nstep in the formation of actin stress fibers through a post-translational\r\nmechanism (Mack et al., 2001;\r\nBishop and Hall, 2000). We\r\ninvestigated the role of this pathway in the regulation by tropoelastin of\r\nactin polymerization. The addition of actinomycin D\r\n(Greenburg et al., 1986), an\r\ninhibitor of gene transcription, or cycloheximide\r\n(Greenburg et al., 1986), an\r\ninhibitor of protein translation, did not block tropoelastin-induced actin\r\npolymerization in Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 2E). Furthermore, a\r\nspecific inhibitor of the Rho signaling pathway that targets Rho kinase,\r\nY276', '32 (Mack et al., 2001;\r\nUshata et al., 1997), blocked\r\ntropoelastin mediated actin polymerization of Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 2E). Additionally,\r\ntropoelastin treatment of Eln-/- vsmc did not alter the\r\namount of SM  actin transcript or protein levels as quantified by\r\nnorthern and western blot analysis but did shift the filamentous:globular\r\n(F:G) actin ratio from 1:1 to 3.1:1 (data not shown). These experiments, in\r\ncombination with the failure of either transcription or translation inhibitors\r\nto inhibit tropoelastin-induced actin stress fiber formation in\r\nEln-/- vsmc, suggest that elastin modulates vsmc phenotype\r\nby regulating actin treadmilling via a signal transduction pathway involving\r\nRho GTPases and their effector proteins. \r\nTo evaluate further the effect of elastin on the contractile phenotype in\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells, we examined the organization of vinculin,\r\ntubulin and desmin in Eln+/+ and\r\nEln-/- cells (Burridge\r\net al., 1996). Vinculin is concentrated in focal adhesion plaques\r\nthat bind the actin cytoskeleton and connect with the cell membrane. Indirect\r\nimmunofluorescent staining for vinculin revealed abundant focal adhesion\r\nplaques in 94% of Eln+/+ cells when scored by observers\r\nblinded to genotype (Fig.\r\n2F,J). By contrast, only 12% of Eln-/- cells\r\nhad a normal distribution of defined focal adhesion plaques\r\n(Fig. 2G,J). Within 3 hours of\r\nexposure to recombinant tropoelastin protein, the percentage of\r\nEln-/- cells with defined focal adhesions increased 6-fold\r\nto 79% (Fig. 2I,J). Treatment\r\nhad no effect on focal adhesion organization in Eln+/+\r\ncells (Fig. 2H,J).\r\nImmunostaining for other cytoskeletal proteins, tubulin\r\n(Fig. 2K,L) and desmin (data\r\nnot shown) showed no difference between Eln+/+', ' and\r\nEln-/- cells. Thus, the loss of elastin in vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells does not lead to a broad disruption of cytoskeletal architecture.\r\nThese results indicate that elastin induces a mature, contractile phenotype in\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells by regulating the organization of specific\r\ncytoskeletal proteins. \r\nElastin controls the migration of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nVascular proliferative disease involves the migration of smooth muscle\r\ncells from the arterial media to the subendothelial space, forming a neointima\r\n(Schwartz, 1997). The same\r\nphenomenon is observed during the development of Eln-/-\r\narteries. We postulated that the elastin matrix surrounding each concentric\r\nlayer of vascular smooth muscle cells provides a cue that localizes these\r\ncells to the arterial media, and prevents their migration to the neointima. To\r\ntest this hypothesis, we used a modified Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay. We\r\ndiscovered that vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to tropoelastin in a\r\ndose-dependent manner (Fig.\r\n3A). Cell migration depended on the concentration gradient of\r\ntropoelastin, not the total amount used in the assay. Chemotaxis was minimal\r\nfor cells in control (0/0 ng/ml) and static fields of tropoelastin (200/200\r\nng/ml), but increased significantly as the concentration gradient of\r\ntropoelastin rose to 200 ng/ml. A similar but less dramatic effect was seen\r\nwith cells that produce elastin (Fig.\r\n3A), suggesting that the synthesis and secretion of elastin by\r\nEln+/+ cells reduced migration to external stimuli. These\r\ndata demonstrate that elastin is a potent chemoattractant for vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells. \r\nView larger version (18K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 3. Elastin controls migration of vascular smooth muscle cells. (A)\r\nEln+/+ and Eln-/- vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells migrate to tropoelastin in a concentration-dependent manner,\r\nindicating that tropoelastin is a specific and direct stimulus for vascular', '\r\nsmooth muscle cell localization. In addition, Eln-/- cells\r\nconsistently migrated at a higher rate than Eln+/+ cells,\r\nsuggesting that the autocrine production of elastin by\r\nEln+/+ cells reduces their chemotaxis to external stimuli.\r\n(B) Tropoelastin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell migration to the\r\nchemotactic growth factor PDGF. A modified Boyden chamber assay was used for\r\nall experiments to determine the total number of migrated cells in 15 randomly\r\nselected high power microscope fields (HPF). Data shown are the\r\nmean±s.e.m. from three independent wells.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nCytokines and growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor\r\n(PDGF), are thought to mediate the subendothelial migration of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells in occlusive vascular lesions\r\n(Lusis, 2000;\r\nBornfeldt et al., 1993). To\r\ndetermine if elastin matrix deposited in the arterial media can counteract the\r\npotent chemotactic activity of PDGF, we repeated the Boyden chamber\r\nexperiments. At a PDGF concentration of 30 ng/ml, Eln-/-\r\ncells showed a fourfold increase in chemotactic activity\r\n(Fig. 3B). Increasing\r\nconcentrations of tropoelastin prevented Eln-/- cell\r\nmigration towards PDGF (Fig.\r\n3B). Similar results were observed in Eln+/+\r\ncells. These data suggest that elastin provides a local cue that prevents\r\nvascular smooth muscle cells from migrating away from the arterial media to\r\nthe subendothelial space. Together, these in vitro experiments demonstrate\r\nthat elastin is a potent and specific regulator of vascular smooth muscle cell\r\nmaturation, migration and proliferation. \r\nElastin signals via a non-integrin, G-protein coupled signaling\r\npathway\r\nTo determine whether elastin has a direct signaling effect, we examined the\r\nmolecular mechanism of the regulation by elastin of vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells. Though various binding proteins, chaperones and other matrix elements\r\nthat interact with elastin have been identified and cloned, the mechanism of\r\nelastin signaling remains', ' to be elucidated\r\n(Mecham and Hinek, 1986;\r\nHinek et al., 1988;\r\nMecham et al., 1991; Grosso et\r\nal., 1991b; Hinek, 1995;\r\nHinek, 1996;\r\nPrivitera et al., 1998). Using\r\nin vitro assays of migration and actin polymerization, we examined the\r\nsignaling cascade stimulated by elastin in Eln-/- vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells. Above, we demonstrate that elastin mediates actin\r\npolymerization through a Rho mediated signal transduction pathway\r\n(Fig. 2E). Cell-surface\r\nreceptors that are known to regulate the Rho signaling pathway include the\r\nintegrins and G-protein-coupled receptors\r\n(Seasholtz et al., 1999;\r\nWei et al., 2001). Integrins\r\nare a well-characterized family of receptors that recognize matrix proteins\r\nsuch as collagen, vitronectin, fibulin and fibronectin. Although elastin is\r\nnot a known ligand for integrins, recent work suggests that the integrins may\r\nbe involved in elastin signaling through an intermediary, fibulin 5\r\n(Nakamura et al., 2002;\r\nYanagisawa et al., 2002).\r\nFibulin 5 interacts directly with elastin, and serves as a ligand for\r\ncell-surface integrins. Integrins require extracellular divalent cations to\r\nbind their matrix ligands, and low doses of chelators such as EDTA block these\r\ncell-matrix interactions (Brockdorff et\r\nal., 1998). As expected, control experiments demonstrated that\r\nintegrin mediated migration of vascular smooth muscle cells to collagen was\r\nEDTA sensitive (Fig. 4A).\r\nHowever, EDTA did not interfere with tropoelastin-mediated migration or actin\r\npolymerization of Eln-/- cells\r\n(Fig. 4A,B). In addition,\r\nblocking antibodies to integrins known to bind other matrix proteins such as\r\ncollagen and fibulin 5 did not perturb elastin-mediated actin polymerization\r\nor chemotaxis (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly suggest', ' that the\r\nintegrin family of receptors is not involved in elastin signaling. \r\nView larger version (31K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 4. Tropoelastin regulates migration and actin polymerization via a\r\nnon-integrin, G-protein-coupled signaling pathway. (A)\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells migrate to recombinant\r\ntropoelastin in an EDTA insensitive manner. By comparison, we show that\r\nvascular smooth muscle cell migration to collagen, which is mediated by\r\nintegrins, is EDTA sensitive. (B) Tropoelastin mediated actin polymerization\r\nof Eln-/- cells is EDTA insensitive. (C) Migration of\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells towards tropoelastin\r\nis pertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments with the B protomer of\r\npertussis toxin alone demonstrate that the effect of pertussis toxin is\r\nspecific to its ability to inhibit G-protein signaling. The migration of\r\nEln-/- cells to PDGF (30 ng/ml) is insensitive to\r\npertussis toxin. This control experiment demonstrates that\r\nEln-/- cells treated with pertussis toxin can respond\r\nnormally to stimuli other than tropoelastin. (D) Tropoelastin-mediated actin\r\npolymerization of Eln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells is\r\npertussis toxin sensitive. Control experiments demonstrate that the B protomer\r\nof pertussis toxin does not inhibit actin polymerization. Together, these\r\nexperiments indicate that tropoelastin regulates vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nthrough a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein signaling pathway. (E) Cholera\r\ntoxin (ctxn) and forskolin (frskln) increase the baseline levels of cAMP in\r\nEln-/- vascular smooth muscle cells by constitutive\r\nactivation of the Gs pathway. In the presence of tropoelastin and\r\nforskolin, there is a marked decrease in cAMP. A similar decrease in cAMP\r\nlevels is observed when tropoelastin is added to cholera toxin pretreated\r\ncells. The reduction in cAMP was blocked by', ' pertussis toxin and not B-protomer\r\nindicating a Gi specific pathway. These experiments indicate that\r\ntropoelastin activates a receptor that signals through Gi to\r\ninhibit adenylate cyclase, and reduce cAMP levels. (F) Tropoelastin activates\r\nRhoA in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments\r\ndemonstrate that tropoelastin treatment of Eln-/- cells\r\nresults in a marked elevation of activated RhoA. This response is pertussis\r\ntoxin sensitive and B-protomer insensitive indicating that tropoelastin\r\nactivation of the Rho pathway requires Gi activity. (G) Proposed\r\nmolecular mechanism for tropoelastin-mediated actin polymerization in vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are the largest family of transmembrane\r\nreceptors and are known to activate Rho kinase\r\n(Seasholtz et al., 1999;\r\nMarinissen and Gutkind, 2001).\r\nGPCRs signal through heterotrimeric G proteins classified into four protein\r\nfamilies: Gs, Gi, Gq and G12/13\r\n(Marinissen and Gutkind,\r\n2001). Pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of Gi\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000), blocked\r\ntropoelastin-mediated migration and actin polymerization of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells (Fig. 4C,D). The\r\nspecificity of pertussis toxin inhibition was demonstrated in a series of\r\ncontrol experiments. First, migration of vascular smooth muscle cells to\r\nplatelet-derived growth factor is not dependent on a G-protein-coupled\r\nsignaling pathway and was not disrupted by pertussis toxin\r\n(Fig. 4C). Second, pertussis\r\ntoxin is composed of two subunits, A and B\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000). The A\r\nprotomer inhibits Gi by ADP ribosylation, while the B protomer\r\nfacilitates the entry of the toxin into the cell. In the presence of B\r\nprotomer alone, there was no disruption of either migration or actin\r', '\npolymerization (Fig. 4C,D). Using a Ca2+-sensitive dye, fura-2, and immunoprecipitations with\r\nspecific antibodies, we detected no evidence that rapid Ca2+\r\ninflux, tyrosine kinase receptors or the Map kinase pathway was involved in\r\nelastin signaling (data not shown). Together, these experiments indicate that\r\nelastin signaling is mediated via a non-integrin and pertussis toxin-sensitive\r\nG-protein-coupled signaling pathway. \r\nThe pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, Gi, inhibits adenylate\r\ncyclase, the enzyme responsible for generating cAMP\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000). To\r\nobtain direct biochemical evidence that tropoelastin signals through\r\nGi, we measured the level of cAMP in tropoelastin-treated cells. To\r\nmeasure a reduction in cAMP level, it was necessary to increase the baseline\r\ncellular levels of cAMP using either forskolin or cholera toxin, agents that\r\nactivate adenylate cyclase (Thomas et al.,\r\n2000; Coward et al.,\r\n1999). When tropoelastin was added to either forskolin or cholera\r\ntoxin pretreated cells, the reduction in cAMP levels was between 40 and 60%,\r\nindicating that Gi was activated and inhibited adenylate cyclase\r\nactivity (Fig. 4E). These\r\nreductions in cAMP levels are comparable with those observed with other\r\nligands known to activate Gi via known G-protein-coupled receptors\r\n(Thomas et al., 2000;\r\nCoward et al., 1999). The\r\nreduction in cAMP was pertussis toxin sensitive, which confirmed the role of\r\nGi. Thus, tropoelastin activates Gi and reduces cAMP\r\nlevels. Finally, consistent with the activation of Gi, we found no evidence\r\nfor rapid Ca2+ influx, a prominent feature of Gq\r\nactivation, in our cellular system. Although GPCRs activate the Gi\r\npathway and ligands for many of these receptors have not been identified, our\r\ndata does not rule out the possibility that elastin might indirectly activate\r\nthe GPCR pathway at the level of the heterotrimeric G', ' proteins. \r\nOthers have shown that the GPCRs pathway can trigger the Rho signaling\r\ncascade (Seasholtz et al.,\r\n1999; Wei et al.,\r\n2001; Kabarowski et al.,\r\n2000). In this cascade, activated RhoA stimulates Rho kinase. We\r\nexamined whether tropoelastin stimulated the RhoA signaling pathway via\r\nactivation of a G-protein-coupled signaling pathway. Immunoprecipitation\r\nexperiments demonstrate that tropoelastin activates RhoA through a pertussis\r\ntoxin-sensitive mechanism (Fig.\r\n4F). Together, our pharmacological and biochemical data lead us to\r\npropose a molecular mechanism for elastin signaling\r\n(Fig. 4G). In vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells, elastin activates a pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein-coupled\r\npathway that stimulates Gi, inhibits adenylate cyclase, reduces\r\ncAMP levels and stimulates Rho induced actin polymerization. In the absence of\r\nelastin synthesis, this mechanism is disrupted and vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells lose their contractile phenotype. Thus, there is a direct role for\r\nelastin in controlling vascular smooth muscle cells. \r\nElastin reduces the vascular proliferative response to arterial\r\ninjury in vivo\r\nThe in vitro experiments described above demonstrated that elastin is an\r\nautocrine factor that induces a contractile state, inhibits proliferation and\r\nlocalizes vascular smooth muscle cells to the vessel wall. These data suggest\r\nthat disruption of a crucial morphogenic signal in the vessel wall may release\r\nsmooth muscle cells to dedifferentiate, proliferate and occlude mature\r\narteries. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we used a porcine model to\r\ndetermine whether the application of exogenous elastin to a site of vascular\r\ninjury would reduce the neointimal accumulation of smooth muscle cells and\r\narterial stenosis. \r\nPorous sheaths of elastin matrix were generated from porcine carotid\r\narteries using established methods (Malone\r\net al., 1984). The purity of the elastin was confirmed by scanning\r\nelectron microscopy (Fig. 5A),\r\nimmunohistochemistry,', ' amino acid composition and desmosine content\r\n(Starcher, 1977) (data not\r\nshown). The amino acid composition and the concentration of the crosslinking\r\namino acids desmosine, isodesmosine and lysinonorleucine revealed no\r\nmicrofibrillar proteins or other impurities. Elastin sheaths were secured to\r\nintracoronary stents (Fig. 5B)\r\nand successfully deployed in porcine coronary arteries using standard\r\ncatheterization techniques. The biocompatibility of elastin sheaths was\r\nassessed 3 days and 14 days after placement in the porcine coronary artery.\r\nElastin sheaths did not evoke an inflammatory or thrombotic response (data not\r\nshown). Moreover, elastin sheaths were biologically stable and did not degrade\r\nwithin the arterial wall during the course of animal studies. These\r\nexperiments demonstrate that elastin sheaths can be used to restore elastin\r\nmatrix to sites of vascular injury. \r\nView larger version (80K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 5. Elastin therapy reduces vascular smooth muscle cell accumulation and\r\narterial obstruction in vivo. (A) Scanning electron micrographs of elastin\r\nsheaths. Scale bar: 10 µm. (B) Elastin matrix sheath covering an expanded\r\nmetal stent. (C,D) Representative cross-sections taken from control arteries\r\n(n=14) display the development of a thick fibrocellular neointima\r\n(C), whereas the neointima is substantially decreased in elastin sheath\r\n(arrows) treated arteries (n=13) with the same injury score (D).\r\n(E,F) Over a range of injury, the percent lumen stenosis (E) and mean\r\nneointimal thickness (F) were significantly reduced (both\r\nP<0.0001) in injured porcine coronary arteries treated with\r\nelastin sheath-stents compared with control stents.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nTo determine if elastin sheaths would reduce vascular smooth muscle\r\naccumulation and neointimal formation, we used an established porcine coronary\r\ninjury model of', ' in-stent restenosis\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1992;\r\nSchwartz et al., 1994). Two\r\nmajor coronary arteries of domestic pigs received either a control stent or an\r\nelastin sheath-covered stent following vascular injury caused by balloon\r\noverexpansion. Four weeks after injury and stent placement, representative\r\ncross-sections taken from control arteries displayed a thick fibrocellular\r\nneointima (Fig. 5C). By\r\ncontrast, neointimal formation was substantially reduced in elastin\r\nsheath-treated arteries (Fig.\r\n5D). Standard measurements of mean neointimal thickness (NIT) and\r\npercent stenosis were measured and correlated with the degree of injury\r\ninduced by stent placement. The well-established correlation between the\r\nseverity of injury and the amount of neointimal accumulation\r\n(Schwartz et al., 1994) is\r\nreproduced in our experiments with the control stents. Throughout the range of\r\ninjury scores, there is a significant reduction in the NIT and percent\r\nstenosis in elastin sheath-treated arteries, with the greatest benefit at the\r\nhighest injury scores (Fig.\r\n5E,F). At a mean injury score of 2, when stent placement disrupts\r\ninternal elastic lamella and lacerates the arterial media, elastin sheaths\r\nreduced the mean neointimal thickness by 52% as compared with controls. The\r\nspecificity of the effect of elastin as a stent coating is supported by the\r\nwork of our group and others with non-elastin sheaths. Sheaths made from\r\ncollagen, fibrin or synthetic biopolymers failed to reduce neointimal\r\nthickness compared with bare stents and were frequently associated with a\r\nworse outcome (Goodwin et al.,\r\n2000; McKenna et al.,\r\n1998; van der Giessen et al.,\r\n1996; van Beusekom et al.,\r\n1998). Thus, consistent with the in vitro results, our in vivo\r\nexperiments indicate that restoration of elastin matrix to a site of injury\r\nreduces vascular smooth muscle accumulation and limits neointimal\r\nformation. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTOP', '\r\nSUMMARY\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\xa0\r\nElastin is a critical regulatory molecule within the arterial\r\nwall\r\nWe conclude that elastin is a critical regulatory molecule that controls\r\nthe phenotypic modulation, proliferation and migration of vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells. This conclusion is based on the following observations. First,\r\ncells that lack elastin proliferate at a rate twofold greater than wild-type\r\ncells. Second, cells that lack elastin fail to form a mature contractile\r\nphenotype, which is characteristic of wild-type cells. Third, cells that lack\r\nelastin migrate more aggressively to an exogenous chemoattractant than\r\nwild-type cells. Fourth, all of these aberrant phenotypes induced by the\r\nabsence of elastin can be rescued in vitro by the addition of recombinant\r\ntropoelastin. Fifth, elastin exerts its regulatory function on vascular smooth\r\nmuscle cells by activating a G-protein coupled signaling pathway. Finally,\r\nrestoring elastin to a site of vascular injury in vivo reduces the neointimal\r\naccumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Thus, elastin matrix deposited\r\nby vascular smooth muscle cells in the arterial media provides a local cue\r\nthat regulates these cells in vitro and in vivo. \r\nElastin-VSMC signaling is a critical morphogenic signal that is\r\ndisrupted during the pathogenesis of vascular disease\r\nVascular smooth muscle cells are able to exist in a quiescent contractile\r\nstate or a proliferative non-contractile state\r\n(Raines and Ross, 1993;\r\nOwens, 1998). This plasticity\r\nenables the vascular system to regenerate and grow. However, plasticity must\r\nbe balanced by the need to maintain a mature and stable structure capable of\r\ncirculating blood throughout a whole animal. Because vascular smooth muscle\r\ncells modulate their phenotype readily, external factors must instruct them to\r\nremain in a mature state if homeostasis is to be achieved. Our data indicate\r\nthat the elastin matrix is a potent autocrine factor that regulates arterial\r\nmorphogenesis by instructing vascular smooth muscle cells to', ' localize around\r\nthe elastic fibers in organized rings and remain in a quiescent, contractile\r\nstate (Fig. 6A). This\r\ncell-matrix interaction is mediated via a heterotrimeric G-protein signaling\r\npathway that activates downstream rho GTPases and appears to be crucial for\r\nstabilizing and maintaining the structure of the mature artery. When this\r\nmorphogenic signal is absent during arterial development, the unregulated\r\nmigration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells results in\r\nocclusion of the arterial lumen (Li et\r\nal., 1998) (Fig.\r\n6B). This leads us to propose that focal disruption or destruction\r\nof the elastin matrix in the mature artery by factors such as mechanical\r\ninjury or inflammation play an important and direct role in the fibrocellular\r\nresponse characteristic of proliferative vascular diseases\r\n(Fig. 6C). Previously, emphasis\r\nwas placed on the pivotal role of inflammatory cells in regulating vascular\r\nsmooth muscle cells through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors\r\n(Lusis, 2000;\r\nRoss, 1995). In our model, the\r\ndegradation of elastin by macrophages, T-cells and their proteases acts to\r\nrelease vascular smooth muscle cells from their mature contractile state to\r\nmigrate, proliferate and form a neointima. Thus, the disruption of an\r\nessential morphogenic signal contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular\r\ndisease. \r\nView larger version (37K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\xa0\r\nFig. 6. Model of elastin-vascular smooth muscle cell interactions in development\r\nand disease. (A) During normal development, vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nsynthesize and secrete elastin polymers that form concentric rings of elastic\r\nlamellae around the arterial lumen. Elastin provides mechanical support to the\r\nvessel wall, and signals vascular smooth muscle cells to localize around the\r\nelastic lamellae and remain in a quiescent, contractile state. (B) In the\r\nabsence of elastin, this morphogenic signal is lost resulting in pervasive\r\nsubendothelial migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells\r\nthat occludes the', ' vascular lumen. (C) This leads us to propose that the focal\r\ndisruption and/or destruction of elastin in the mature artery by vascular\r\ninjury releases smooth muscle cells to dedifferentiate, migrate and\r\nproliferate, and contributes to neointimal formation.\r\n\xa0\r\n \r\nFour lines of evidence support our model of elastin-vascular smooth muscle\r\nsignaling in the pathogenesis of vascular proliferative diseases. \r\nPathology\r\nDisruption of elastin matrix is consistently associated with vascular\r\nproliferative diseases in human pathological specimens\r\n(Sandberg et al., 1981;\r\nSims, 2000;\r\nSims et al., 1989). Moreover,\r\nthe severity of occlusive vascular pathology increases in proportion to the\r\nmagnitude of defects and discontinuities in the elastin matrix\r\n(Sims et al., 1989). It has\r\nalso been noted that the programmed intimal hyperplasia and arterial occlusion\r\nrequired for the closure of the ductus arteriosis is associated with impaired\r\nelastic fiber formation (Hinek et al.,\r\n1991). \r\nGenetic\r\nWe previously showed in human genetic studies that loss-of-function\r\nmutations in elastin is sufficient to cause a human vascular proliferative\r\ndisease, supravalvular aortic stenosis and Williams-Beuren syndrome\r\n(Li et al., 1997;\r\nCurran et al., 1993; Ewart,\r\n1993). In these diseases, there is an aggressive occlusive pathology that\r\ndevelops throughout the arterial tree of affected children in the absence of\r\ncommon risk factors for vascular disease. \r\nExperimental\r\nIn murine gene-targeting experiments, we demonstrated that loss of elastin\r\nis sufficient to cause occlusive vascular pathology\r\n(Li et al., 1998). This\r\npathology was caused by the unregulated proliferation, migration and\r\naccumulation of vascular smooth muscle cells in the subendothelial space\r\n(Fig. 6B). In this model,\r\nsevere arterial obstruction occurs in the absence of an inflammatory response\r\nor hemodynamic stress. \r\nTherapeutic\r\nIn this manuscript, we show that exogenous tropoelastin can control the\r\nprol', 'iferation, migration and maturation of vascular smooth muscle cells in\r\nvitro, and reduce the development of fibrocellular pathology in vivo. Other\r\ninvestigators have shown that matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, which\r\nprevent the degradation of matrix components, can reduce neointimal formation\r\n(Zaidi et al., 2000).\r\nTogether, these data indicate that the destruction of the elastin matrix is a\r\ncritical step in the fibrocellular response characteristic of vascular\r\nproliferative disorders. Although strongly indicative, definitive proof of a\r\nrole for elastin signaling in a vascular proliferative response requires\r\nfurther studies. \r\nElastin is unique among vascular extracellular matrix proteins\r\nThe extracellular matrix is known to play a crucial function in the\r\nregulation of vascular smooth muscle cell biology. The myriad associations and\r\ninteraction between the many structural proteins, proteoglycans and growth\r\nfactors of the vascular matrix makes it difficult to distinguish the effects\r\nof each element from one another. However, numerous in vitro studies have\r\ndemonstrated the ability of matrix proteins such as collagen, fibronectin and\r\nlaminin to affect vascular smooth muscle cell activity, including phenotypic\r\nmodulation, migration and proliferation\r\n(Raines, 2000;\r\nHedin et al., 1999). These\r\ndata might suggest that there is overlap and redundancy with regard to the\r\nfunction of different vascular matrix proteins. Elastin, however, is unique\r\namong matrix elements in that the disruption of this gene leads to a vascular\r\nproliferative pathology in human and animal models. Disruption of other genes\r\nencoding vascular matrix proteins, including fibulin, fibrillin and collagen\r\nis associated with either arterial tortuosity, dissection or aneurysm\r\nformation in vivo, not proliferative or occlusive vascular pathology\r\n(Nakamura et al., 2002;\r\nYanagisawa et al., 2002;\r\nArteaga-Solis et al., 2000;\r\nDietz and Mecham, 2000).\r\nMoreover, the specificity of the effect of elastin in vivo is supported by\r\nstudies showing that collagen matrix-covered stents do not reduce neointimal\r\nformation in a porcine model of restenosis\r\n', '(Goodwin et al., 2000). Thus,\r\nelastin, when compared with other matrix proteins, is effective in both in\r\nvitro and in vivo experimental models. From these studies one would expect\r\nthat targeted disruption of the elastin signaling mechanism would replicate\r\nphenotypes observed in Eln-/- cell and mice. \r\nRestoration of elastin for the treatment of proliferative vascular\r\ndiseases\r\nOur work suggests that understanding the link between vascular development\r\nand disease may provide an alternative and potentially complementary strategy\r\nfor the treatment of vascular proliferative diseases. Previously, emphasis has\r\nbeen placed on improving the outcome of vascular disease by inhibiting smooth\r\nmuscle cell proliferation with coronary stents coated with either\r\nradioactivity or chemotherapeutic drugs such as rapamycin, actinomycin D and\r\npaclitaxil (Heldman et al.,\r\n2001; Leon et al.,\r\n2001; Sousa et al.,\r\n2001). These treatments use a common strategy of disrupting\r\nfundamental pathways such as microtubule assembly, DNA stability, and\r\nregulatory cell cycle proteins that are required in virtually all actively\r\ndividing cells. We present work that suggests restoring a natural morphogenic\r\nsignal to the vessel wall may also be therapeutically beneficial. Clearly,\r\nadditional work is needed to verify that results with murine and porcine\r\nmodels are recapitulated in humans. \r\n \r\n \xa0\xa0\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\xa0\r\nWe thank Bob Mecham for assistance with synthesizing recombinant\r\ntropoelastin, confirming the purity of the elastin sheath and recombinant\r\ntropoelastin, providing the polyclonal murine tropoelastin antibody, and\r\ndiscussions; Roy Biran (Keck Center for Tissue Engineering) for antibodies and\r\nhelp with fluorescent imaging; and Mary Scriven for assistance in generating\r\nmanuscript figures.
