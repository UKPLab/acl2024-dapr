The magnitude of the minority interest in the subsidiary company is generally less than 50% of outstanding shares, or the corporation would generally cease to be a subsidiary of the parent.[1]", "It is, however, possible (such as through special voting rights) for a controlling interest requiring consolidation to be achieved without exceeding 50% ownership, depending on the accounting standards being employed. Minority interest belongs to other investors and is reported on the consolidated balance sheet of the owning company to reflect the claim on assets belonging to other, non-controlling shareholders. Also, minority interest is reported on the consolidated income statement as a share of profit belonging to minority shareholders.", "The reporting of 'minority interest' is a consequence of the requirement by accounting standards to 'fully' consolidate partly owned subsidiaries. Full consolidation, as opposed to partial consolidation, results in financial statements that are constructed as if the parent corporation fully owns these partly owned subsidiaries; except for two line items that reflect partial ownership of subsidiaries: net income to common shareholders and common equity. The two minority interest line items are the net difference between what would have been the common equity and net income to common, if all subsidiaries were fully owned, and the actual ownership of the group. All the other line items in the financial statements assume a fictitious 100% ownership.", "Some investors have expressed concern that the minority interest line items cause significant uncertainty for the assessment of value, leverage and liquidity.[2] A key concern of investors is that they cannot be sure what part of the reported cash position is owned by a 100% subsidiary and what part is owned by a 51% subsidiary.", "Minority interest is an integral part of the enterprise value of a company. The converse concept is an associate company.", "Under the International Financial Reporting Standards, the non-controlling interest is reported in accordance with IFRS 5 and is shown at the very bottom of the Equity section on the consolidated balance sheet and subsequently on the statement of changes in equity. Under US GAAP minority interest can be reported either in the liabilities section, the equity section, or the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. The Mezzanine section is located between liabilities and equity. FASB FAS 160 and FAS 141r significantly alter the way a parent company accounts for non-controlling interest (NCI) in a subsidiary. It is no longer acceptable to report minority interest in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet."], "passage_types": ["table", "table", "table", "list", "list", "table", "list", "table", "list", "list", "list", "table", "list", "list", "list", "table", "list", "list", "list", "list", "list", "list", "table", "list", "list", "list", "table", "list", "list", "list", "list", "list", "table", "list", "table", "list", "table", "list", "list", "table", "table", "list", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text", "text"], "long_answers": [42, 43], "document_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org//w/index.php?title=Minority_interest&amp;oldid=780744824"}

In the United Kingdom, \"Love Will Keep Us Alive\" was issued as a single and peaked at number 52 on the UK Singles Chart.[2]", "Aside from being on the album Hell Freezes Over, the song appears on the Eagles' box set, Selected Works 1972-1999 and the 2003 compilation album, The Very Best Of.", "Paul Carrack recorded the song for his 1996 album, Blue Views; it also featured on his 2006 compilation album, Greatest Hits - The Story So Far.", "In 2011, Paul Carrack and Timothy B. Schmit recorded the song in London with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and released it in the UK on the Carrack label.", "According to the liner notes that accompanied their 2003 greatest hits CD, this song was written when Carrack, Capaldi, and Schmit were planning to form a band with Don Felder and Max Carl during the late eighties or early nineties.[3] The band had the working name of Malibu Men's Choir.[4] This never materialized, so Schmit proposed the song for the Eagles' reunion album. According to Felder, they sent demo tapes to the Eagles manager, Irving Azoff, who rejected it as not good enough.[5] Felder thought it ironic that the Eagles would later record one of those rejected songs.[6]", "Glenn Frey - harmony and backing vocals, rhythm guitar\nDon Henley - harmony and backing vocals, drums\nDon Felder - harmony and backing vocals, slide guitar\nJoe Walsh - harmony and backing vocals, rhythm guitar\nTimothy B.
