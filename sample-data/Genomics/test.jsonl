In mice, scrapie incubation time is controlled by polymorphisms at PrP codons 108 (leucine or phenylalanine) and 189 (threonine or valine), but the precise role of each polymorphism in the control of disease is unknown. The L108F and T189V polymorphisms are present in distinct structural regions of PrP and thus provide an excellent model with which to investigate the role of PrP structure and gene variation in TSEs. Two unique lines of transgenic mice, in which 108F and 189V have been targeted separately into the endogenous murine Prnpa gene, have been produced. TSE inoculation of inbred lines of mice expressing all allelic combinations at codons 108 and 189 has revealed a complex relationship between PrP allele and incubation time. It has been established that both codons 108 and 189 control TSE incubation time, and that each polymorphism plays a distinct role in the disease process. Comparison of ME7 incubation times in mouse lines that are heterozygous at both codons has also identified a previously unrecognized intramolecular interaction between PrP codons 108 and 189.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-5","text":"Published online ahead of print on 5 January 2005 as DOI 10.1099\/vir.0.80525-0.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-6","text":"A supplementary figure showing ME7 and 301V incubation times in mice expressing codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms is available in JGV Online.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-7","text":"Present address: Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), Veterinary Research Division, TSE Research Unit, Dean Stanley Street, London, UK.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-8","text":"Present address: Department of Genetics and Genomics, Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, UK.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-9","text":"INTRODUCTION\r\nTop\r\nABSTRACT\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMETHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\u00a0\r\nThe transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are a group of fatal, neurodegenerative diseases that include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, chronic wasting disease in deer and elk and Creutzfeldt\u0096Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann\u0096Str\u00e4ussler\u0096Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia in man. TSE diseases are thought to be caused by conversion of a normal cellular glycoprotein (PrPC) into an abnormal, disease-associated isoform (PrPSc) that accumulates in diseased tissue (Prusiner, 1996). This conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is accompanied by an alteration in conformation from predominantly -helix to -sheet structure and development of partial resistance to digestion with proteinase K (PK). It has been proposed that PrPSc constitutes infectivity (Prusiner, 1982) and acts as a seed or template in the conversion of host PrPC to PrPSc (Jarrett & Lansbury, 1993; Prusiner, 1996; Weissmann, 1996). Whether PrPSc is indeed the infectious agent remains to be established, but the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc is clearly a critical event in the pathogenesis of these diseases.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-10","text":"The host PrP gene (Prnp) has a major influence over the outcome of TSE disease.

A much smaller difference of 13\u00a0days was produced by the L to F polymorphism at codon 108 (FT\/FT), demonstrating that both codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms can alter murine scrapie incubation times independently.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-30","text":"View this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\u00a0\r\nTable 1.

This breeding strategy produced 10 lines of transgenic mice, each with a different PrP allelic combination.

There is no obvious pattern of allelic combination associated with increasing incubation time (see Supplementary Figure in JGV Online), with the exception that the two shortest incubation times are in mice that are homozygous for 189T (155 and 168\u00a0days) and the two longest are in mice that are homozygous for 189V (295 and 325\u00a0days), in keeping with identity at codon 189 with the source of the agent (LT\/LT). However, homozygosity at codon 189 does not always produce extreme incubation times, as LT\/FT and LV\/LV mice have intermediate incubation times of 196 and 261\u00a0days, respectively (Table\u00a01).\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-33","text":"An association between genotype and incubation time can be identified when the 10 lines are examined by the allelic combinations at either codon 108 or codon 189 (Table\u00a01). When lines are sorted into groups by codon 189 genotype (189TT, 189VV or 189FV), the effect of codon 108 on incubation time is the same in each of the three groups: the shortest incubation times occur when the codon at 108 is homozygous for either L or F, although the shorter of the two is always 108LL, matching that of the source of the inoculum (LT\/LT). Therefore, at codon 108, heterozygosity always leads to increased incubation times with respect to the combination at codon 189, despite the inoculum matching one allele at codon 108. Indeed, incubation times in excess of those in Prnpb (FV\/FV) mice were observed in FV\/LV mice [Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Figure (available in JGV Online)]. However, when sorted by codon 108 genotype (108LL, 108FF or 108LF), a different pattern of incubation time is observed. For each of the three groups, homozygosity for threonine at codon 189 (which matches the source of the inoculum) gives the shortest incubation times and homozygosity for valine (which does not match the inoculum) gives the longest incubation times, whilst the heterozygotes (TV) produce intermediate incubation times. Hence, at codon 108, ME7 incubation times follow the pattern LL<FF<LF, whilst at codon 189, the pattern of incubation time is TT<TV<VV. These results show that the effect on incubation period depends upon the combination of PrP alleles, particularly the presence of homozygosity or heterozygosity at codons 108 and 189 and on identity with the source of the inoculum at these positions in PrP.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-34","text":"Interactions between codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms and the 301V strain\r\nIn contrast to ME7 challenge, LT\/LT mice inoculated with the Prnpb (FV\/FV)-passaged strain 301V have long incubation periods of 240\u00a0days. Similarly, FV\/FV mice that have long ME7 incubation periods produce short incubation periods of 125\u00a0days with 301V. The role of codons 108 and 189 in the control of 301V incubation time was explored by challenge of FT\/FT and LV\/LV mice. Incubation times of 141 and 202\u00a0days were obtained in the LV\/LV and FT\/FT lines of mice, respectively, compared to 125\u00a0days in FV\/FV mice and 240\u00a0days in LT\/LT mice (Table\u00a01). Hence, in agreement with the data obtained from inoculations with ME7, both codons 108 and 189 are responsible for the control of incubation time for the 301V agent strain. Similarly to ME7, the greatest effect was produced by the T to V alteration at codon 189 (100\u00a0days reduction). However the L to F change produced a greater effect on incubation time with 301V (60\u00a0days reduction) than with ME7, again showing that challenge with an agent that shows identity at codon 108 or 189 results in the shortest incubation times (Table\u00a01). The full range of allelic combinations has not been examined with this strain of TSE agent. In addition, no incubation time is available for the LT\/FT line. Six LT\/FT mice were culled due to welfare reasons between 327 and 377\u00a0days and all showed positive TSE pathology on examination of the brain tissue, suggesting an incubation time in excess of that of the LT\/LT line (240\u00a0days). However, the combinations that were examined have produced patterns of incubation-time alteration identical to those identified with ME7 [Table\u00a01 and Supplementary Figure (available in JGV Online)], with the exception that the F1 cross LT\/FV has an incubation time in excess of those of both parental lines. This overdominance is characteristic of 301V and can be observed with other TSE strains. Thus, the pattern of incubation time for 301V appears to be FF<LL<LF at codon 108 and VV<TV<TT at codon 189. This pattern is the same as that observed for ME7, where heterozygosity results in extended incubation times for 108LF, but intermediate incubation times with 189TV.

These results showed that amino acids 108 and 189 in murine PrP exert the major control over scrapie incubation time in Prnpa and Prnpb lines of mice, but could not determine whether either or both of the polymorphisms were responsible for this control. By targeting each polymorphism separately into the murine Prnpa gene, we have been able to analyse the specific effects of codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms in co-isogenic mice, both independently and in several different allelic combinations. Inoculation of these lines with two scrapie strains has shown that both codons 108 and 189 in murine PrP are responsible for control of scrapie incubation time in mice, as incubation times in LV\/LV and FT\/FT mice are distinct from those produced in LT\/LT and FV\/FV mice. The shortest incubation times were obtained when PrP expressed from both alleles matched the PrP in the inoculum (LT\/LT for ME7 and FV\/FV for 301V). Correspondingly, long incubation times were obtained for LT\/LT mice with 301V and FV\/FV mice with ME7. However, from analysis of the other allelic combinations, it was apparent that shortened incubation times were also obtained in lines where codon 189 matched the source of the inoculum and the residues on both alleles at codon 108 were homogeneous. Of these, the shortest incubation times occurred when these residues at codon 108 matched the source of inoculum. In lines heterozygous at both codons 108 and 189 (with LT and FV molecules in one case, and LV and FT molecules expressed in the other), shorter incubation times were observed in the line expressing PrP that matched the source of inoculum (LT\/LT for ME7). The importance of homozygosity at codon 108 and identity with the inoculum at codon 189 suggests that these areas of the protein play very different roles in the disease process.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-41","text":"The control of incubation time is thought to be due to PrP sequence identity between the host and the donor of infectivity. However, our results show that short incubation times are obtained in FT\/FT mice inoculated with LT\/LT-derived ME7 and in LV\/LV mice inoculated with FV\/FV-derived 301V, despite the sequence incompatibility between donor and host at codon 108. Hence, although codon 108 polymorphisms can affect scrapie incubation time independently, the major control is due to identity with the source of inoculum at codon 189. The inoculation of mice expressing different combinations of PrnpLT, PrnpFV, PrnpLV and PrnpFT produced a complex series of incubation times (see Supplementary Figure in JGV Online). It was clear that, in addition to identity with the inoculum at codon 189, homozygosity at codon 108 consistently gave rise to shorter incubation times in both 108L\/L- and 108F\/F-expressing lines. Heterozygosity at codon 108 always resulted in extended incubation times with respect to the genotype at codon 189. Although the series of allelic crosses produced for these experiments are described as homozygous and heterozygous at codons 108 and 189, expression from both Prnp alleles in a heterozygote will result in the presence of two different PrP populations in the cell. It is interactions between these proteins, and not between Prnp alleles, that will determine the incubation time of disease. Hence, the nature or combination of PrP variants in the recipient may be more important than PrP identity with the inoculum, indicating that interactions between amino acids 108 and 189, either on the same or different proteins, is a critical part of disease propagation.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-42","text":"It has been proposed that the production of PrPSc is a two-step process that involves binding of PrP-res (PK-resistant PrP) to PrP-sen (PK-sensitive PrP), followed by the conversion of PrP-sen to PrP-res (Caughey, 2001). However, it is unknown which process requires PrP amino acid identity. Cell-free conversion experiments have shown that mouse PrP-res (108L_111V) will convert mouse PrP-sen expressing the 3F4 epitope (108M_111M), but not hamster PrP-sen (also possessing the 3F4 epitope), even though both proteins were found to bind to mouse PrP-res (Horiuchi et al., 2000). Deletion mutants lacking residues 34\u0096113 (MoPrP34\u0096113) also bound to mouse PrP-res and converted, albeit with reduced efficiency (Lawson et al., 2001). These results imply that amino acid 108 is not required for either initiation of conversion or binding to PrPSc, but may be involved in the control of the rate of conversion and final conformation of PrP-res (Lawson et al., 2004). Moreover, MoPrP34\u0096113 was found to bind heterologous PrPSc, but, unlike the full-length molecule, did not prevent the conversion of homologous PrPC, again suggesting that this region is involved in the control of conversion, but not binding (Lawson et al., 2001). The 34\u0096113 truncation of PrPC was also found to affect the solubility of the molecule, as loss of these residues reduced the percentage of PrP-sen that was seen to self-aggregate when incubated under cell-free assay conditions in the absence of PrP-res. This region may therefore be responsible for some degree of multimerization\/aggregation of PrP-sen, which may be beneficial for conversion (Lawson et al., 2001).\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-43","text":"The individual effects of codon 108 and 189 polymorphisms in PrP have also been modelled in vitro by expressing recombinant 108F_189T and 108L_189V PrP in Escherichia coli (Brown et al., 2000). These intermediate forms of PrP were found to be less stable than both PrP-A (108L_189T) and PrP-B (108F_189V) and were observed to lose their normal conformation and gain some PK resistance over time. It was proposed that inheritance of either 108F or 189V alone may be a disadvantage in terms of mouse survival, and that mice expressing either of these polymorphisms separately could potentially develop spontaneous disease (Brown et al., 2000). However, the recently reported existence of a Prnpc (108F_189T)-expressing line (Lloyd et al., 2004) and the data presented here for transgenic FT\/FT and LV\/LV lines show that such mice are viable and do not develop any neurological phenotype during their lifespan. PrP expressed in the brains of transgenic LT\/LT and FV\/FV mice is PK-sensitive and expressed at levels identical to those in wild-type mice of both genotypes. These results demonstrate clearly that in vitro and in vivo studies can produce very different outcomes; these may be due to the difference in PrP post-translational modification and\/or the physiological environment of the native protein.\r\n"},{"id":"15722549-44","text":"From the data presented here, we predict that: (i) polymorphisms at PrP codon 189 control the initial interaction and binding with the agent, as incubation times reflect a preference for sequence identity between the host and inoculum at codon 189; and (ii) polymorphisms at codon 108 control the rate of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc, where the ability to induce multimerization of PrPC and increase the efficiency of conversion is favoured when all PrP expressed in a cell is homogeneous in the N-terminal region. Alternatively, the preference for codon 108 homozygosity may reflect a more complex interaction between host PrPC and PrPSc that is less efficient in the presence of heterogeneous protein populations. However, the importance of codon 108 homozygosity in murine scrapie transmission may explain the role of PrP codon 129 in human TSE disease, where the majority of CJD cases occur in individuals who are homozygous for methionine or valine at codon 129 (Palmer et al., 1991; Zeidler et al., 1997; Alperovitch et al., 1999).

Coding polymorphisms of the mouse prion protein gene (Prnp) are known to influence incubation time (Westaway et al., 1987; Moore et al., 1998) and therefore all mice tested were Prnpa (Leu-108, Thr-189). While BSE transmits readily to wild-type mice, there is nevertheless a substantial transmission barrier (Wells et al., 1998; Wadsworth et al., 2001), which results in long and variable incubation times and an incomplete attack rate on primary passage (Hill et al., 1997; Asante et al., 2002) (Table\u00a01) compared with the passage of mouse adapted-prions in mice. Primary passage of BSE prions in mice usually results in a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on a Western blot that closely resembles the PrPSc types seen in cattle BSE and human vCJD (type 4) (Hill et al., 1997; Somerville et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1996). Most of the inbred lines tested (C57BL\/6JOlaHsd, FVB\/NHsd, NZW\/OlaHsd, SM\/J and SWR\/OlaHsd) corresponded to this pattern (Fig.\u00a01 and unpublished data; Asante et al., 2002). However, two strains (SJL\/OlaHsd and RIIIS\/J) produced an alternative PrPSc type where the fragment sizes appeared the same but the glycoform ratios were different such that the mono-glycosylated glycoform was dominant (Fig.\u00a01; Asante et al., 2002). Passage of cattle BSE (I783) in C57BL\/6 mice gave, as reported previously, a prolonged incubation time (710\u00b115\u00a0days); however, passage of cattle BSE (I783) in SJL mice gave a very much shorter incubation time (196\u00b113\u00a0days) (Table\u00a01; Asante et al., 2002). Neuropathological findings were unremarkable with only diffuse PrP staining in both inbred mouse lines (Asante et al., 2002). We also inoculated C57BL\/6 mice with another cattle BSE inoculum (I038) (Collinge et al., 1996). On Western blots, both I783 and I038 show the same di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern (Fig.\u00a01a), which has, to the best of our knowledge, been observed in all UK BSE cattle brain isolates reported to date. C57BL\/6 mice inoculated with I038 did not show clinical signs of disease (0\/12) at >839\u00a0days (Table\u00a01; Collinge et al., 1996). However, I038 has been used in many transmissions in our laboratory and has transmitted efficiently with a consistent di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on Western blots following transmission to various lines of inbred mice (Fig.\u00a01b; Hill et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1995, 1996).\r\n"},"judgement":2,"belonging_doc":{"id":"15269389","title":"\r\nCharacterization of two distinct prion strains derived from bovine spongiform encephalopathy transmissions to inbred mice\r\n","chunks":[{"id":"15269389-0","text":"Characterization of two distinct prion strains derived from bovine spongiform encephalopathy transmissions to inbred mice\r\nSarah E.

Reliable comparisons of mouse prion strain properties can only be achieved after passage in genetically identical mice, as host prion protein sequence and genetic background are known to modulate prion disease phenotypes. While multiple prion strains have been identified in sheep scrapie and Creutzfeldt\u0096Jakob disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is thought to be caused by a single prion strain. Primary passage of BSE prions to different lines of inbred mice resulted in the propagation of two distinct PrPSc types, suggesting that two prion strains may have been isolated. To investigate this further, these isolates were subpassaged in a single line of inbred mice (SJL) and it was confirmed that two distinct prion strains had been identified. MRC1 was characterized by a short incubation time (110\u00b13\u00a0days), a mono-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc type and a generalized diffuse pattern of PrP-immunoreactive deposits, while MRC2 displayed a much longer incubation time (155\u00b11\u00a0days), a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc type and a distinct pattern of PrP-immunoreactive deposits and neuronal loss. These data indicate a crucial involvement of the host genome in modulating prion strain selection and propagation in mice. It is possible that multiple disease phenotypes may also be possible in BSE prion infection in humans and other animals.\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-5","text":"INTRODUCTION\r\nTop\r\nABSTRACT\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMETHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\u00a0\r\nPrion diseases or transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders that include Creutzfeldt\u0096Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in animals. Prion diseases are characterized by their prolonged incubation periods and distinctive neuropathology, which includes an accumulation in affected brains of an abnormal isomer (PrPSc) of host-encoded cellular prion protein (PrPc). The conversion of PrPc to PrPSc involves conformation change resulting in increased -sheet secondary structure (Pan et al., 1993) and is associated with detergent insolubility and the acquisition of partial resistance to protease digestion (Meyer et al., 1986). According to the protein-only hypothesis (Griffith, 1967), PrPSc is the principal, if not sole, component of the infectious agent (Prusiner, 1991).\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-6","text":"Multiple prion strains have been described that are distinguished by their incubation periods and patterns of neuropathology when passaged in inbred lines of mice, and these distinctive phenotypes are preserved on multiple passage in the same host (for review, see Bruce et al., 1992). The existence of prion strains challenges the protein-only hypothesis of prion propagation. However, it is clear that prion strains are associated with biochemical differences in PrPSc itself including differences in conformation (Hill et al., 1997, 2003; Bessen & Marsh, 1992, 1994; Collinge et al., 1996; Telling et al., 1996; Wadsworth et al., 1999), glycosylation (Hill et al., 1997, 2003; Collinge et al., 1996) and overall protease resistance (Kuczius & Groschup, 1999). That these strain-associated biochemical differences in PrPSc fragment sizes and glycoform ratios following proteolysis can be transmitted to PrP in an experimental host argues that they may be responsible for encoding strain diversity. While the precise nature of the molecular basis of prion strain diversity is unclear, that prion strains may be distinguished by the differing molecular mass of fragments following partial proteinase K digestion and by differing ratios of di-, mono- and unglycosylated PrPSc is clear. Using this approach, we described four common PrPSc types in humans (Collinge et al., 1996; Wadsworth et al., 1999; Hill et al., 2003). PrPSc types 1\u00963 are seen in sporadic and iatrogenic CJD, while type 4 PrPSc is exclusively associated with variant CJD (vCJD) and is associated with a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on a Western blot (Collinge et al., 1996; Hill et al., 2003). This characteristic glycoform ratio is also seen in BSE-infected cattle brain and these observations, together with bioassay data from wild-type and transgenic mice and non-human primates, have proved critical in establishing a link between BSE and vCJD (Hill et al., 1997; Bruce et al., 1997; Lasm\u00e9zas et al., 1996; Collinge et al., 1996; Asante et al., 2002). This characteristic molecular signature of BSE-derived prion isolates is seen in all UK cattle BSE cases examined and, together with biological strain typing studies in inbred and transgenic mice, suggests that BSE is caused by a single strain of agent (Hill et al., 1997; Bruce et al., 1994, 2002; Collinge et al., 1996; Kuczius & Groschup, 1999; and our unpublished data). This molecular pattern, in additional to biological characteristics, is also maintained on transmission to other hosts such as domestic cat, sheep, macaque and other exotic animals, either by natural exposure or by experimental transmission (Bruce et al., 1994; Fraser et al., 1994; Collinge et al., 1996; Hill et al., 1998; Lasmezas et al., 2001). Recent data from French and Italian screening programmes suggest that more than one strain of BSE may exist in cattle (Biacabe et al., 2004; Casalone et al., 2004). We have also shown that on BSE transmission to a line of transgenic mice expressing only human PrP Met-129, Tg(HuPrP129M+\/+Prnp0\/0)-35, two distinct molecular phenotypes can be produced: one that mirrors the vCJD phenotype with type 4 PrPSc and an additional molecular phenotype that is indistinguishable from that of sporadic CJD with PrPSc type 2 (Asante et al., 2002). These transgenic mice were generated on a mixed genetic background, and one possibility was that the different patterns were determined by background effects in individual mice (Asante et al., 2002). This interpretation was supported by the demonstration that vCJD and BSE prions on primary passage to a series of inbred lines of mice were also able to produce two distinct molecular phenotypes on Western blotting, dependent only on the genetic background of the mice (Asante et al., 2002). These data argued that two distinct strains had been propagated from cattle BSE. However, since the parameters that distinguish prion strains (incubation time, neuropathology and PrPSc type) are also known to be modulated by host genetic background, these cannot be adequately compared after primary passage in different lines of inbred mice (Bruce, 1993; Moore et al., 1998; Somerville, 1999). We therefore subpassaged these mouse-adapted BSE prions in the same inbred mouse line to determine whether distinctive biological characteristics resulted, indicative of different strains, and whether these correlated with the different PrPSc types propagated in the animals.\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-7","text":"METHODS\r\nTop\r\nABSTRACT\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMETHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\u00a0\r\nTransmission studies.\r\nSJL\/OlaHsd (SJL) and C57BL\/6JOlaHsd (C57BL\/6) mice were obtained from Harlan UK Ltd (Bicester, UK).

Coding polymorphisms of the mouse prion protein gene (Prnp) are known to influence incubation time (Westaway et al., 1987; Moore et al., 1998) and therefore all mice tested were Prnpa (Leu-108, Thr-189). While BSE transmits readily to wild-type mice, there is nevertheless a substantial transmission barrier (Wells et al., 1998; Wadsworth et al., 2001), which results in long and variable incubation times and an incomplete attack rate on primary passage (Hill et al., 1997; Asante et al., 2002) (Table\u00a01) compared with the passage of mouse adapted-prions in mice. Primary passage of BSE prions in mice usually results in a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on a Western blot that closely resembles the PrPSc types seen in cattle BSE and human vCJD (type 4) (Hill et al., 1997; Somerville et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1996). Most of the inbred lines tested (C57BL\/6JOlaHsd, FVB\/NHsd, NZW\/OlaHsd, SM\/J and SWR\/OlaHsd) corresponded to this pattern (Fig.\u00a01 and unpublished data; Asante et al., 2002). However, two strains (SJL\/OlaHsd and RIIIS\/J) produced an alternative PrPSc type where the fragment sizes appeared the same but the glycoform ratios were different such that the mono-glycosylated glycoform was dominant (Fig.\u00a01; Asante et al., 2002). Passage of cattle BSE (I783) in C57BL\/6 mice gave, as reported previously, a prolonged incubation time (710\u00b115\u00a0days); however, passage of cattle BSE (I783) in SJL mice gave a very much shorter incubation time (196\u00b113\u00a0days) (Table\u00a01; Asante et al., 2002). Neuropathological findings were unremarkable with only diffuse PrP staining in both inbred mouse lines (Asante et al., 2002). We also inoculated C57BL\/6 mice with another cattle BSE inoculum (I038) (Collinge et al., 1996). On Western blots, both I783 and I038 show the same di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern (Fig.\u00a01a), which has, to the best of our knowledge, been observed in all UK BSE cattle brain isolates reported to date. C57BL\/6 mice inoculated with I038 did not show clinical signs of disease (0\/12) at >839\u00a0days (Table\u00a01; Collinge et al., 1996). However, I038 has been used in many transmissions in our laboratory and has transmitted efficiently with a consistent di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc pattern on Western blots following transmission to various lines of inbred mice (Fig.\u00a01b; Hill et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1995, 1996).\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-15","text":"View this table:\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\u00a0\r\nTable 1.

The level and distribution of spongiosis (vacuolation) was similar for both groups (Fig.\u00a03a and b, and Fig.\u00a04a and b). Spongiosis was most prominent in the cortex, hippocampus and thalamus with some involvement of the brain stem and basal ganglia, while the cerebellum was spared.

However, recent data from French and Italian cattle suggest that more than one strain of BSE may exist (Biacabe et al., 2004; Casalone et al., 2004). Strain typing may be carried out in many ways (Safar et al., 1998; Peretz et al., 2002) but strains were originally defined and classified by their characteristics on passage to particular inbred lines of mice based on incubation time and patterns of neuropathological targeting, and more recently have been distinguished by PrPSc type on Western blots. A mouse prion strain difference should only be assessed in the same line of inbred mouse, as genetic background is known to modulate all the defining features of a prion strain (Bruce, 1993; Moore et al., 1998). Based on these criteria, we have isolated two distinct strains from cattle BSE, which we have designated MRC1 and MRC2, respectively. MRC1 showed a mono-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc type on Western blots. It was derived from a primary BSE passage in SJL\/OlaHsd mice and had a relatively short incubation time and a generalized diffuse pattern of PrP immunostaining in the brain. MRC2 shows a di-glycosylated-dominant PrPSc type on Western blots, was derived from a primary BSE passage in C57BL\/6JOlaHsd mice and had a relatively long incubation time and showed a distinctive pattern of PrP immunoreactivity and neuronal loss.\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-26","text":"SJL mice were able to support both the MRC1 and MRC2 strain patterns. However, it will be important to establish whether these strains are stable on further passage in SJL and other strains of mice. Both C57BL\/6 and SJL mice share the same PrP amino acid sequence and therefore the strain selection must be a feature of other genetic loci. Within the limits of resolution available from Western blotting, the fragment sizes following proteinase K digestion were the same for the PrPSc associated with both strains, raising the possibility that the differences related to glycosylation and not to gross conformational differences, at least as differentiated by proteinase K digestion. Additional studies will be required to characterize precisely the conformation and physico-chemical properties of PrPSc associated with these prion strains.\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-27","text":"Although recent reports suggest that alternative strains of BSE can be found in cattle, previous studies have suggested that BSE is caused by a single strain of agent (Bruce et al., 1994; Biacabe et al., 2004; Casalone et al., 2004). 301V and 301C represent previously reported independent BSE strains; however, these were propagated in different strains of mice, which not only had very different genetic backgrounds (VM\/Dk and C57) but also had two amino acid coding differences in PrP and therefore their \u0091strain\u0092 characteristics cannot be directly compared.

We are confident that our findings are not the result of contamination with mouse scrapie as these transmissions were performed in accordance with rigorous biosafety protocols for preparation of inocula, inoculations and care of mice. Disposable equipment was used for each inoculum and each mouse was identified with a unique transponder. In addition, the MRC1 strain was also seen on primary passage to RIIIS mice and also on primary passage of vCJD to SJL mice (Asante et al., 2002). vCJD is caused by a BSE-like prion strain (Hill et al., 1997; Bruce et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1996); therefore, it is not surprising that the same phenomenon is seen with both vCJD and BSE prions in the same strains of mice. Further transmission studies are under way to characterize these vCJD-derived mouse strains. A similar bifurcation of the BSE strain characteristics was also observed with independent BSE inocula in transgenic mice expressing human PrP with methionine at codon 129, Tg(HuPrP129M+\/+Prnp0\/0)-35 (Asante et al., 2002).\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-29","text":"MRC2 and MRC1 were derived from different sources of BSE prions, I038 and I783, respectively. I038 originated from a pool of five infected cow brainstems. However, our extensive transmission studies with these isolates excluded the pooling of material from five cows as the source of the strain variation that we observe in these transmissions. I038 gave the \u0091classical\u0092 BSE signature and the novel phenotype was derived from I783, which originated from a single cow brain. I783 has been used for transmissions in several inbred lines of mice in our laboratory and consistently produces the MRC2 strain (as determined by Western blotting) in C57BL\/6JOlaHsd, FVB\/NHsd, NZW\/OlaHsd, SM\/J and SWR\/OlaHsd mice. However, it also consistently produces the MRC1 strain (as determined by Western blotting) in SJL\/OlaHsd and RIIIS\/J mice (Fig.\u00a01b, lane 3 and Asante et al., 2002). DNA sequence analysis of the bovine Prnp gene in I783 confirmed that the animal was homozygous for PrP amino acids, thereby excluding PrP heterozygosity as the source of the strain bifurcation. I038 and other independent BSE inocula have also been shown to produce two \u0091strains' in Tg(HuPrP129M+\/+Prnp0\/0)-35 transgenic mice, which are on a mixed genetic background. We therefore believe that the prion strain selection or \u0091mutation\u0092 is a feature of the genetic background of the mice and studies are under way to identify the genes involved. Although recent data suggest that more than one strain of BSE may exist in cattle (Biacabe et al., 2004; Casalone et al., 2004), in this study, both I038 and I783 appeared to be the same single strain. However, Western blotting was unable to determine whether a mixed population of strains already existed in either of these brains or whether the alternative strains were generated de novo in the mice. The inbred lines studied to date represent only a small proportion of the allelic variation that exists in the mouse genome; therefore, the study of other strains of mice, particularly those derived from unrelated strains such as trapped wild mice, may reveal additional BSE-derived strains.\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-30","text":"The human population exposed to BSE has a much more diverse genetic background than can be observed using laboratory strains of inbred mice. Therefore, it is possible that BSE infection may be revealed not only as the type 4 PrPSc and associated vCJD clinicopathological phenotype seen to date (Collinge et al., 1996; Hill et al., 2003), but in future, may also present with alternative PrPSc types, incubation times and neuropathology that may not be distinguishable from sporadic CJD (Hill et al., 1997; Asante et al., 2002) or represent additional novel phenotypes (Collinge, 1999). BSE may also have infected sheep flocks in the UK and, given the genetic diversity of sheep breeds, it is also possible that in some breeds BSE propagates as a strain type that is indistinguishable from natural sheep scrapie.\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-31","text":"\r\n"},{"id":"15269389-32","text":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe thank R.

According to the protein-only hypothesis, the transmissible agent, or prion, is composed principally or entirely of abnormal isoforms of a host-encoded glycoprotein, prion protein (PrP) (Prusiner, 1982). The disease-related isoform, PrPSc, is derived from its normal cellular precursor, PrPC, by a post-translational process that involves a conformational change (Pan et al., 1993). PrPSc can be distinguished biochemically from PrPC by its partial protease resistance and detergent insolubility (McKinley et al., 1983).\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-7","text":"Classical CJD (sporadic and iatrogenic CJD) is rare and the infectious agent is mainly found in the central nervous system. These factors have made the risk of iatrogenic infection from surgical instruments rather low. Even so, iatrogenic transmission of classical CJD via neurosurgical instruments, despite their routine sterilization, has been reported (Bernoulli et al., 1977). Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that classical CJD may also be transmitted by other surgical procedures (Collins et al., 1999).\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-8","text":"The appearance of variant CJD (vCJD) in the UK from 1995 onwards, and the experimental confirmation that it is caused by the same prion strain that causes BSE in cattle (Bruce et al., 1997; Collinge et al., 1996; Hill et al., 1997), raised concerns that an epidemic of vCJD will occur as a result of the extensive exposure of the UK population to BSE prions between 1980 and 1996 (Cooper & Bird, 2002a, b, c). BSE has now been recognized in cattle herds from most countries in the European Union, the USA, Japan and Canada and the possibility remains of BSE prion infection in sheep flocks. vCJD has been reported from France, Italy, Ireland and the USA. The majority of vCJD cases have occurred in the UK and, while the number of cases remains relatively small (150), it continues to rise. Recent estimates based on mathematical modelling and the clinical cases of vCJD to date suggest that the total epidemic may be relatively small (Ghani et al., 2003), but key uncertainties, notably with respect to major genetic effects on incubation period (Lloyd et al., 2001), suggest the need for caution and also such models cannot estimate the number of asymptomatic, infected individuals. It is the latter that is most relevant to assessing risks of iatrogenic transmission and the number of currently infected individuals is unknown. Human prion incubation periods, as evidenced by kuru, may span decades. Also, in addition to pre-clinically infected individuals, the possibility of subclinical carrier states of prion infection in humans, as recognized in several animal models, must also be considered (Asante et al., 2002; Hill et al., 2000). A retrospective study of archived surgical lymphoreticular specimens (largely appendix) has recently reported 3 out of 12 674 positive for PrP immunoreactivity and estimated prevalence of infection at 237 per million (95 % confidence interval 49\u0096692 per million) (Hilton et al., 2004). Appendix appears to be a less sensitive reporter of vCJD prion infection than tonsil (Joiner et al., 2002) and this retrospective study may therefore have underestimated prevalence. A prospective national-scale anonymous screen of discarded tonsillectomy tissue for PrPSc was announced by the Chief Medical Officer of the UK and is now under way to try to estimate better the prevalence of asymptomatic infection with vCJD prions in the community. There is therefore a significant potential risk of secondary transmission of vCJD via medical and surgical procedures performed on asymptomatic individuals incubating the disease. A possible transfusion-associated case of vCJD has indeed already been reported (Llewelyn et al., 2004).\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-9","text":"Importantly, the pathogenesis of prion diseases varies with different host species and prion strain combinations. It is clear that the pathogenesis of vCJD differs substantially from that of other forms of CJD in that, unlike classical CJD, lymphoreticular tissues, including lymph nodes, are extensively (and uniformly) involved, with PrPSc levels in tonsil up to 10 % of those seen in brain (Wadsworth et al., 2001). PrPSc is also readily detectable in retina and optic nerve and, at lower levels, in some other tissues, including rectum, in vCJD (Wadsworth et al., 2001). Such tissue distribution means that many common surgical procedures pose a potential risk of iatrogenic transmission, including abdominal surgery, tonsillectomy and gastrointestinal and rectal biopsy (Hill et al., 1999; Wadsworth et al., 2001). Even in classical CJD, the infectivity has been reported from a range of tissues from primate transmission studies, albeit at lower levels than in the central nervous system (Brown et al., 1994). PrPSc is also detectable at low levels in skeletal muscle and other tissues in some sporadic CJD patients (Glatzel et al., 2003).\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-10","text":"It is established that prions are highly resistant to conventional chemical and physical procedures designed to inactivate viruses and bacteria, including treatment with organic solvents, formaldehyde and detergents and sterilization at 121 \u00b0C (Taylor, 1989, 1991; Taylor et al., 1994). The degree of resistance varies between different strains of prions, with differences in the relative protease resistance of PrPSc (Groschup et al., 2000) and thermal inactivation of prion infectivity (Taylor et al., 2002). It is well established that PrPSc is an excellent surrogate marker of prion infectivity but in certain circumstances infectivity and PrPSc respond differently to treatment. Heating of some TSE strains has been shown to reduce infectious titre significantly without reducing the level of PrPSc quantifiable within a Western blot (Somerville et al., 2002). Decontamination methods that demonstrate activity against PrPSc must therefore be verified by bioassay for infectivity itself.\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-11","text":"Surgical stainless steel is capable of binding prions avidly and acting as a remarkably efficient reservoir of infectivity (Flechsig et al., 2001; Zobeley et al., 1999). Indeed, a contact time as short as 5\u00a0min with prion-infected mouse brain, despite subsequent exhaustive washing, is sufficient for high titres of infectivity to be adsorbed to steel wire (Flechsig et al., 2001). Insertion of such wires into the brains of indicator mice for only 30\u00a0min was enough to transmit disease. Infectivity bound to metal was found to persist far longer in the brain than when injected as a homogenate, which may explain the high efficiency of infection mediated by a prion-coated, steel surface (Flechsig et al., 2001).\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-12","text":"A combination of the widespread tissue distribution, the potentially high prevalence of clinically silent vCJD infection and the robustness of the infectious agent prompted a risk assessment by the UK government and the introduction of measures aimed at reducing the risk of iatrogenic transmission via blood and blood products and contaminated instruments. An audit of, and subsequent improvements to, hospital sterilization facilities was carried out and single-use instruments were introduced for all tonsil surgery in the UK in 2001, but later suspended in England because of concerns about a higher surgical complication rate.\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-13","text":"In view of the prion transmission risk, the development of effective human prion decontamination protocols, validated for metal-bound prions, remains a key public health priority in the UK and elsewhere. The currently available decontamination protocols are based on studies with infected brain homogenates and macerates, not metal-bound prions, and are limited to animal not human prion strains. Although strains of mouse-passaged BSE are available, the nature of passage through rodent hosts results in a mouse-adapted strain that no longer behaves identically to the original bovine inoculum. To address this problem, we have sought readily available and inexpensive agents that destroy prion infectivity without damaging the instruments being decontaminated. Conditions normally used for inactivating prions \u0096 typically, powerful oxidizing agents or strong alkalis \u0096 are highly corrosive both to the instruments and the washing equipment used in hospital sterilizing units and present a hazard to those involved in their handling.\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-14","text":"Previous studies have indicated that proteolytic methods could be used for prion decontamination. Using mouse-adapted BSE prions (strain 3O1V), McLeod et al. (2004) found that treatment with Properase was inefficient, leading only to a modest increase in incubation time rather than a reduction in the number of animals infected.

With both enzymes, the progress curves are complex and cannot be described by simple zero- or first-order kinetics. This complexity is likely to result from a number of factors, including differential rates of PrPC\/PrPSc digestion, non-uniform susceptibility of PrPSc in different environments and enzyme autolysis during the incubation. An additional complication is an initial increase in immunoreactivity following the first 5\u00a0min digestion with proteases. This is likely to result from breakdown of aggregates normally resistant to SDS denaturation so that, following proteolysis, this PrP can enter the gels. Despite these limitations, these data showed a close fit to a double-exponential function (with a relatively protease-sensitive component and a second, much more resistant, fraction) and this was used phenomenologically to analyse the data. In each case, the digestions were performed in 2 % SDS, the omission of which reduced the effectiveness of the digestion by at least an order of magnitude and led to poor reproducibility of results (data not shown).\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-39","text":"View larger version (43K):\r\n[in this window]\r\n[in a new window]\u00a0\r\nFig. 1.

Hence, although the enzymic degradation described above represents a very significant reduction in the level of detectable PrPSc, the question remained as to what effect there was upon infectivity for metal-bound prions, as assessed by mouse bioassay. We have previously reported that infectivity bound to steel wires is capable of transmitting infection, with attack rates and incubation periods similar to those seen following intracerebral (i.c.) injection of infectious brain homogenates (despite the much smaller amount of surface-bound material compared with a homogenate injection) (Weissmann et al., 2002). Previous work had also confirmed that untreated steel wires are not toxic when inserted intracerebrally (data not shown). In this study, we chose to use RML prions, owing to the fact that there is no animal model for the bioassay of vCJD that fully lacks a species or transmission barrier, thereby considerably limiting the sensitivity of such assays.

Direct i.c. inoculation of a 1 % (w\/v) RML homogenate also produced a 100 % clinical attack rate, with a similar incubation period (63\u00b10\u00b75\u00a0days) to the infected wires.\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-50","text":"The encouraging data from the in vitro studies on vCJD brain homogenate, described above, were supported by almost complete destruction of detectable surface-bound infectivity when assayed in the indicator mice (Table\u00a03; Fig.\u00a04b). Indeed, of 18 mice successfully implanted following the three-stage decontamination regime with SDS, PK and Pronase, only one succumbed to disease and with a considerably prolonged incubation period of 101\u00a0days. In distinction to standard mouse titrations using serial dilution of tissue homogenates, it is more difficult to quantify titre of infectivity in these metal wire experiments (Flechsig et al., 2001); however, these bioassay results are consistent with the findings of the in vitro studies (Fig.\u00a03).\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-51","text":"Disturbingly, autoclaving at 134 \u00b0C, while clearly reducing the infectious titre of wire-bound material, as evidenced from the increased incubation period, still allowed 100 % transmission of disease (Table\u00a03). In this experiment, for local biosafety reasons, wires were transferred to the autoclave inside microfuge tubes partially sealed with loose caps. A subsequent experiment showed that, despite being loosely applied, the caps restrict the entry of steam to the tubes and therefore would have presumably impaired the efficiency of autoclaving (data not shown). In other experiments (Tables\u00a02 and 4; Fig.\u00a04a, c), where wires were fully accessible to steam, autoclaving was more effective.\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-52","text":"Decontamination methods were also assessed using a second mouse model: wild-type CD-1 mice. When exposed to a 20 % (w\/v) homogenate of RML-infected brain, implanted wires produced clinical prion disease in 5 of 7 CD-1 mice with a mean incubation period of 152\u00a0days (Table\u00a04; Fig.\u00a04c). As with Tg20 mice, this was a shorter incubation period than that produced by direct i.c. inoculation of 30\u00a0\u00b5l of a 1 % (w\/v) homogenate of RML. The decontamination methods tested (high-temperature autoclaving, SDS\u0096PK\u0096Pronase treatment, NaOH and red heat) were effective at preventing transmission of disease (Table\u00a04; Fig.\u00a04c). The extreme method of heating the wires until glowing red was included as a secure positive control of prion decontamination.\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-53","text":"DISCUSSION\r\nTop\r\nABSTRACT\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nMETHODS\r\nRESULTS\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\u00a0\r\nDefining effective and practical regimes for the removal of prion infectivity from surgical and medical instruments is an important public health issue in the UK and other countries with significant population exposure to BSE prions, where unknown numbers of individuals may silently harbour prion infection in a range of tissues for many years. No suitable test to detect asymptomatic prion infection exists to date, a situation which precludes the introduction of measures that could limit the spread of infection by this route.\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-54","text":"While the three-stage detergent\/enzymic procedure we have developed will not ensure absolute sterility of prion-contaminated instruments, its application would be expected to degrade any infectivity risk by several orders of magnitude and very substantially reduce risks of iatrogenic transmission of human prion infection during routine surgery. Importantly, the method has been shown to be effective against native vCJD PrPSc in homogenized tissue and against RML prions adsorbed onto surgical steel surfaces rather than simply with tissue homogenates. As there is no sensitive indicator animal in which we could assay vCJD infectivity on the wires, the experimental approach we describe here is the most rigorous available at the moment. The use of stainless steel wires as a model of surgical instruments is an essential element of validating potential decontamination regimes, as metal-bound prions appear to have a higher specific infectivity than prions in tissue homogenates and may be more resistant to degradation (Flechsig et al., 2001).\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-55","text":"The application of extreme heat or incubation in NaOH prior to autoclaving (as recommended by the WHO) confirmed that these methods can be effective against prion-contaminated steel. An independent study using a wire implantation model in hamsters indicated that 134 \u00b0C autoclaving was partially effective, with only 1 of 10 implanted animals succumbing to prion disease (Yan et al., 2004), with a combination treatment of soaking in NaOH followed by autoclaving of a comparable efficiency, with 2 of 10 animals still becoming infected. The application of NaOH is of limited use in a hospital environment where it would be damaging to instruments and a risk to the operator. High-temperature autoclaving at 134 \u00b0C is the mainstay of current UK procedures. It may be effective, but appears sensitive to steam penetration in our experimental model. The application of loose tops to the tubes containing the prion-contaminated wires led to 100 % transmission in subsequent bioassay of the wires. In hospital situations, such full steam penetration and uniform heating of a large load of instruments may not always be achieved, even when the autoclave is functioning optimally. Hence, relying on autoclaving at 134 \u00b0C for prion decontamination may be unsafe. Recent studies of instruments have reported persistence of macroscopic contamination in complex areas of surgical instruments (such as hinges), despite washing prior to autoclaving (Dinakaran & Kayarkar, 2002). It is possible that during routine autoclaving some instruments would be partially protected from the ingress of steam, thereby compromising the effectiveness of autoclaving as a prion decontamination method.\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-56","text":"The use of safe water-soluble reagents such as ionic detergents and proteases in conjunction with autoclaving appears to offer the best approach to improve the effectiveness of existing procedures at decontaminating prion infectivity. It ought to be possible to produce effective formulations of these reagents that can be readily and reproducibly applied in existing hospital washing and sterilization equipment at modest additional expense. While these methods have been experimentally verified on metal surfaces, it will be important to determine whether they are as effective on other surfaces such as neoprene. This type of polymer is a component of sensitive diagnostic instruments such as endoscopes, which will not withstand autoclaving and might also be decontaminated by this detergent\u0096enzyme method.\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-57","text":"\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-58","text":"\r\n"},{"id":"15722550-59","text":"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\n\u00a0\r\nWe thank Ray Young for preparation of figures.
