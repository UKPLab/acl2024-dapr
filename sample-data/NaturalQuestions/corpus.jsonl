His and Allison's romance then becomes strained due to their conflicting loyalties and then by Allison's increasingly violent behaviour because of Gerard's manipulation of Victoria's suicide. After Gerard's defeat and rescuing Jackson in the Season 2 finale, Allison tearfully apologizes for her actions, and because she needs space, they break up, but they still care for each other afterwards.

The Anuk-Ite creates fear those it encounters, and uses that fear to sustain itself. As a result, many of the civilians inside Beacon Hills who previously had contact with the supernatural in some way turn on the supernatural population out of fear, become Hunters and begin hunting down every supernatural creature they can find. While Scott is trying to figure out how to stop the Anuk-Ite, which Gerard is using to build an army of Hunters, it is revealed that he has developed romantic feelings for Malia, as in the episode \"After Images\", Scott is injured by a trap set by Gerard, and when Malia tries to take Scott's pain away so he can heal faster, Scott, who is half-delirious from the pain, confesses that he believes Stiles, Malia's ex-boyfriend, would be fine with them being together.

However, Derek, hearing Paige's screams, changed his mind but saw he was too late to save her and that Paige was actually rejecting the Bite. Knowing that Paige would die instead, Derek broke her spine to end her suffering. The killing of an innocent caused his werewolf eyes to change from yellow to blue, darkening his soul.

Jackson, as the Kanima, commits numerous murders throughout Season 2. Jackson does not know that he is the Kanima, nor does the Kanima side of him know that it is Jackson. In his Kanima form, Jackson was nigh unstoppable: he had enhanced strength and agility that far exceeded the werewolves, even Derek, the Alpha werewolf, the Kanima could heal from being shot by Chris repeatedly, Derek slashing its throat, and Allison putting an arrow in its head and stabbing it in the chest. The Kanima's claws also produced a paralytic poison that could completely immobilize a victim by the Kanima slashing the back of the neck and it could scale walls.

She was actually alive, fully transformed as a coyote. On the night of the car crash Malia had shapeshifted on a full moon. Her shift had supposedly caused the accident, and killed her mom and sister in the process earning her blue eyes by taking innocent lives. In the Season 3B premiere \"Anchors\", Sheriff Stilinski reopens the case under a suspicion a supernatural may have been involved, and Scott and Stiles discover Malia in the woods. In the episode \"More Bad Than Good\", Scott uses his Alpha roar to have Malia return to human form. Sheriff Stilinski and Stiles bring her home and she is reunited with Henry. After eight years as a coyote in the wild, Malia is very in touch with her animal side, is rather brash, quick to fight, and tends to speak her mind.

As the series progress, Malia readjusts to her humanity."},{"id":"train-229909-42","text":"In \"Echo House\", Malia is interned at Eichen House sanatorium. There, she sees Stiles who has voluntarily committed himself. When he walks up to Malia, she attacks him aggressively. Malia tells Stiles she is unhappy as a human, because she now lives back with her father and can't tell him that she killed her mom and sister, and Scott's Alpha roar has caused her to remain human and unable to fully transform again. Stiles, who needs access to the basement for information regarding the Nogitsune's connection to Eichen House, specifically the kanji \"self\" on the wall, makes a deal with her: she helps him get into the basement, then Scott will teach her how to change back. Very soon afterward, they sleep together. Behind a wall in Eichen House, they find the Nogitsune's original host's body, a sheathed katana, and a photo. Afterwards, they are attacked by Oliver, Stiles' roommate, who is being controlled by the Nogitsune. Stiles lets the Nogitsune back in, in exchange for the Kitsune sparing Malia. Malia later prepares to leave Eichen House, intending to rescue Stiles. She eventually brings the sheathed sword and the photo to Scott.

Malia has a survival-of-the-fittest mentality, as shown when she was willing to leave Lydia behind when the Pack was held captive by the Calaveras. She regularly sneaks into Stiles' house at night. Malia is struggling in learning control during the full moon. In \"The Benefactor\", Stiles stays with her on the full moon while she is transformed into her werecoyote shape for the first time; he surmises she lacks control because of her guilt in what she did to her mother and sister. He relates to her because of the Nogitsune's possession of him. Malia perfects control at this. The Pack keeps Malia in the dark that Peter Hale is her biological father, to protect her from the sociopathic werewolf. But in \"Weaponized\" Malia discovers the truth when she sees she is listed on the Dead Pool as \"Malia Hale\". Malia is severely hurt and feels betrayed by Stiles keeping the information from her, straining her relationship with him. Malia meets with Peter, learning from him her real mother is known as 'the Desert Wolf'.

After Scott's encouraging and urging to save Tracy instead, with the latter at her mercy, Malia goes through with it. Unfortunately, Tracy is euthanized by the Dread Doctors at that moment to her horror. Malia soon grows to trust the newcomer Theo Raeken. In \"A Novel Approach\", while on a driving lesson with Theo, after reading Valack's novel, Malia remembers more of the crash that caused her family's death: it was not her full-moon transformation, but a woman that opened gunfire on the car that caused it to go off the road in the first place. She realizes the woman was the Desert Wolf. Unable to deal with it, Malia doesn't tell anyone. She notices Stiles' obvious lies, and starts to lose trust in him.

Stilinski and Stiles are mutually supportive and protective of one another, in part because of the death of Stiles' mother, Claudia, some years before the series timeline."},{"id":"train-229909-60","text":"In Season 1, \"Co-Captain\", Stilinski links the murders committed by the Alpha to the Hale House fire. He discovers an accomplice in the arson, Adrian Harris, who gave him the lead to the culprit, a pendant. In the Season 1 finale, Stilinski finds the body of Kate Argent with the necklace, linking her to the crimes. In Season 2, the Sheriff is again working on solving a killing spree. He is put on temporary leave because of Stiles' behavior throughout the season, straining his relationship with his son. With Stiles' help, he finds out the victims were part of the Beacon Hills High swim team in 2006. He is held hostage at the Sheriff's station with Melissa and their sons by Matt, when they uncover evidence convicting Matt. After the events are resolved and Matt's death, he is reinstated as Sheriff."},{"id":"train-229909-61","text":"In Season 3, Stilinski has a murder spree on his hands, this time committed by the Darach. Stiles is reluctant to let his father in on the supernatural loop out of fear he could be killed. Eventually in the episode \"The Girl Who Knew Too Much\", he attempts to tell Stilinski the truth using previous seemingly inexplicable incidents, but Stilinski says he doesn't know what he's seen, harshly trying to end the argument. Stiles talks back, saying, \"Mom would've believed me.\" Stilinski later uncovers information on a hunch about the supernatural and discovers Jennifer Blake about to kill Lydia. He witnesses Jennifer removing her glamour talent to reveal her actual face, the Darach, and Scott in his werewolf shape. Jennifer abducts him for the Guardians' sacrifice. He is held in the Nemeton along with Melissa McCall and Chris Argent. He is now brought up to speed. In \"Alpha Pact\", Stilinski relays a story eight years ago when Claudia was on her deathbed. He was helping a girl who was caught in a car accident. He was holding the girl's hand and her grip tightened. She'd comforted him saying if his wife was dying, he should leave and go be with her. Ultimately, he didn't, waiting for paramedics to arrive instead. Claudia had already died when he arrived and Stiles had been with her. If he'd believed in the supernatural, believed that the girl psychically knew that Claudia was dying, he would've been with his wife in her final moments. He and the parents are rescued by Allison and Isaac just as Jennifer is using the storm to bury them. Stiles arrives holding up the ceiling of the root cellar with an aluminum bat and is reunited with his son."},{"id":"train-229909-62","text":"Finally brought into the supernatural circle, and subsequently closer to Stiles, Stilinski starts to search through old cases which he suspect could involve a supernatural creature, particularly the case of Malia Tate. He asks Scott to help him to find some clue in Malia's house, but this proves unsuccessful. Later, Stiles admits to Scott this action was his last attempt to solve some case when he's still the sheriff, since Rafael, Scott's father is having Stilinski impeached for a \"lack of resolution and ability to close cases\". However, with Scott and Stiles' help in the following episode \"More Bad than Good\", Malia Tate is found alive and he reunites her with her father and Stilinski closes the case. Stilinski temporarily puts his dislike of Rafael aside in \"Riddled\" when Rafael finds Stiles after he goes missing and shakes his hand in gratitude. Stilinski has been taking notes of Stiles' growing symptoms and has him undergo a test for the same disease that killed Claudia. When he sees a brain scan similar to his wife's, he is visibly shaken.[11] However, later, Scott reveals to Stilinski Stiles is possessed by the dark trickster, the Nogitsune. Displaying belief in the supernatural, Stilinski clues in on the fact that the Kitsune is a trickster. He learns Stiles' MRI results are fake: they are virtually similar to his wife's results, courtesy of the Void Kitsune. He recalls his time in the army; he was taught that to defeat a foe, \"you take away their hope\". Rafael helps to talk Stilinski out of the impeachment case, saving his career and admits he only needed a reason to stay in Beacon Hills so he could make things up with Scott. Stilinski attempts to give Rafael some sound advice: that he reveal to Scott why he left. In \"Insatiable\", when he sees the Nogitsune has been exorcised from his son, he gives Stiles a tight hug. In Season 4, Stilinski investigates the murders by the assassin, 'the Mute'. With Derek in tow, he is led to the school, where a Claymore mine is set up, but the assassin shows up. Derek and Stilinski overpower him, then Stilinski attempts to arrest him, but the assassin is killed by Peter. The Sheriff learns of the Dead Pool from Scott and Stiles; he has the hit list run through recognition to find the intended targets. Stilinski and Stiles are having money problems, trying to pay for the MRI and the \"visit\" to Eichen House which are both long overdue. Stiles is tempted to use the Dead Pool money Scott found to help solve the problems. Later on however, because Stiles was almost murdered by Brunski, their Eichen House bill is dropped as a gesture of apology. In the Season 4 finale, \"Smoke and Mirrors\", Stilinski saves Lydia and Mason from a Berserker using the Mute's Claymore, destroying the demon."},{"id":"train-229909-63","text":"In Season 5, Stilinski is constantly given death threats from the delinquent Donovan Donati for his history with Donovan's father. Stiles notes his dad has taken off his wedding ring. In \"Condition Terminal\", Stilinski is against moving Tracy's shapeshifted corpse from a crime scene. Alan counters he'd be holding a press conference announcing the existence of the supernatural. Stilinski stammers, with a growing frustration over having to obscure supernatural aspects in his cases, saying \"There is a line we have to draw\", but reluctantly acquiesces. Stilinski notices Stiles' uncharacteristic silence and withdrawal upon realizing Donovan is a Chimera. In \"Strange Frequencies\", he and Melissa uncover that all the known Chimeras had previous organ transplants from an unknown donor: they were all genetically chimeras beforehand. In \"Ouroboros\", when another unnamed Chimera is found dead, impaled upon Kira's sword, Stilinski culminates by resolutely reporting it with an APB out on Kira to the protest of Melissa, Stiles and Kira's parents. He vehemently argues the girl is murder, it is his job to investigate within the parameters of the law and although his son along with Scott's Pack combat threats outside the law, they're not above it. Melissa humors him writing an official report detailing all the supernatural phenomena present in the town, and sharply tells him \"maybe (he) should learn to bend a little before someone else breaks.\" In \"Lies of Omission\", Stilinski sees Parrish has incarcerated himself because he's the one stealing the bodies. He considers letting it slide, but Parrish resolutely says no. In \"Status Asthmaticus\", Stilinski uncovers clues surrounding Donovan's death, but he's attacked then left to die by Theo. Stiles, horrified, manages to find Stilinski and the latter is hospitalized. Scott, Stiles and Malia uncover he'd been slashed, poisoned by Noah Patrick, a Berserker Chimera. The bone marrow poisoning him is removed by Dr. Geyer and Stilinski recovers, waking up and reassuring Stiles he \"still has (him)\"."},{"id":"train-229909-64","text":"In \"Damnatio Memoriae\", Stilinski recovers from his near-death experience. He talks to Stiles about Donovan's death. Stilinski reassures and advises his son that his only crime was surviving, though his heart is telling him it was murder, and if a judge said differently \"then hell with the judge.\" Stilinski admits he made a mistake in arresting Kira and says he's learning \"to bend.\" Stilinski advises Stiles that the burden he now carries won't ever feel OK again without a counterbalance, like saving a life. He encourages Stiles to reconcile with Scott, saying he'll feel better by forgiving someone if not himself. Stilinski moves forward with his new mindset, keeping Parrish on as a deputy, despite growing increasingly concerned over Parrish's apocalyptic dream and the growing number of bodies committed by the Beast. In \"Amplification\", Stiles alerts him to the danger Lydia's in while in Eichen House. Stilinski talks to a resolutely oblivious Natalie Martin firmly telling her she knows the bigger picture of what's happening in Beacon Hills, giving her the records of Valack's experimentation at Eichen House and Melissa's \"police report\" as proof, which later leads to her finally acknowledging the supernatural. In \"Apotheosis\", the Beast is destroyed (with Mason separated) and the Desert Wolf defeated and captured by Malia and Braeden, Stilinski tells Stiles his role in making all of the above happen must have felt good. Stiles admits it did and he wants to feel it again. Stilinski proudly tells his son: \"Welcome to your future career in law enforcement.\""},{"id":"train-229909-65","text":"In the season 6 premiere \"Memory Lost\", the Sheriff brings Scott in to help find out what happened to a boy's missing parents. After Stiles' encounter with a Ghost Rider, Stilinski doesn't recognise him. In \"Superposition\", the Sheriff and Parrish enter the station as they go over a recent case. His wife Claudia is alive as a result of the Ghost Riders' interference. She waits for him in his office. He asks if she's happy to which she says \"Always\". In \"Sundowning\", Stilinski tells Scott and Lydia that \"Stiles\" is not a thing, but a person. His father Elias was an army engineer and used the nickname Stiles. He denies Scott's request to see Elias as he would be no help to them due to his dementia. He later walks in on Scott, Lydia and Malia visiting Elias. Elias becomes agitated towards his son and tells him to go back to his \"dead wife and loser son\". The Sheriff later tells Scott that he remembers back in college, he and Claudia were discussing their future including having a son named Stiles. In \"Relics\", Stilinski gives Lydia permission to search his house for any possible relics of Stiles. He tells her that he couldn't sleep the night before, he got up to do some paperwork but he stubs his toe on an old baseball bat and, without thinking, he yells out Stiles' name. In \"Radio Silence\", the Sheriff doesn't know how the jeep ended up in the school car park, he admits the vehicle was a junker in the day, but doesn't understand who would want it now. In \"Ghosted\", the Sheriff refuses to acknowledge the possibility that Stiles is his son and that he was taken by the Ghost Riders. He believes the person Scott heard on the radio could've been the result of signal crossing. He later talks to Claudia that someone should write a paper on how she survived the frontotemporal dementia, but she shoots him down and instead talks about replacing the wallpaper Lydia had damaged. In \"Heartless\", Stilinski discovers what he believes to be Stiles' bedroom. He asks Claudia why it was sealed off. She just says there are several simple explanations for the room and tells him to \"leave it alone\" but he cannot. He begins to think that maybe what Scott and Lydia have been telling him was true. Lydia gives him the first clue that he has a son by spotting Stiles' lacrosse jersey in the room and tossing it to him. In \"Blitzkrieg\", the Sheriff starts piecing together that he has a son by running string to the walls of Stiles' room, causing Stiles' possessions to reappear. He later tries to show Claudia Stiles' room full of Stiles' stuff but she sees nothing. He then realises that Claudia isn't real as he can't remember her last birthday or anniversary. Claudia tries to fill his head with false memories but he persists, remembering her \"last good day\" at the hospital. Once he remembers Stiles, Claudia disappears. The Sheriff tells the Pack that he has a son, his name is Mieczyslaw Stilinski but they call him Stiles. He remembers everything about his son, everything from his first time behind the jeep to him dragging Scott into the woods. In \"Memory Found\", Stilinski is shot and erased by the Ghost Riders as he exits the Sheriff's station. In \"Riders on the Storm\", the Sheriff is briefly reunited with Stiles before giving him cover so that Stiles could escape. He later saves Stiles from the conjured up Claudia.

In \"Fury\", Melissa is called to the sheriff's station as a witness, but as she arrives she sees Matt Daehler shoot Scott in the stomach and is horrified. Melissa is held hostage with Stilinski. Melissa comes into contact with the supernatural, witnessing a shapeshifted Derek Hale fight the Kanima, and finally sees Scott as a werewolf. At first, she is horrified, devastated, having trouble coping. She avoids Scott for a week and is even more frightened when Gerard breaks into the house and has the Kanima hold her hostage.

She saves her son by electrocuting them with a defibrillator.

One time, when Scott was only a toddler, Rafael came home drunk and had accidentally knocked Scott down the stairs bruising his head on the floor and she'd kicked Rafael out. Stilinski had answered the domestic distress call, exacerbating spite from Rafael. In the Season 3 finale, the hospital is attacked by the Oni, and Melissa makes Rafael promise her, if she doesn't make it, he is to make things up with Scott.

Scott and Melissa store the Chimera Lucas' corpse in the morgue after the Dread Doctors kill him. Scott mulls that he \"should have done something\". Melissa says his grandfather had a saying; when one says \"I should have\" too much, then \"You're should-ing all over yourself.\" She says she wishes she could be the mother to say Scott can't be involved in the danger of Beacon Hills because he's always going to be at the center of it all, and because he cares.

It's depicted in flashbacks Kate's body had begun to heal after she was killed with Peter's claws: she was coming back to life. The Calavera hunters inconspicuously came to check if Kate was really dead and saw her transforming instead. They switched out Kate's body from the morgue and took her to Mexico. They demanded Kate kill herself to follow the Hunter's Code. Instead Kate faked her suicide, and when the hunters inspected her, she killed half a dozen of Araya's men and escaped.

Derek angrily attacks her, but she reveals she's poisoned his sister Cora with the same plant and only she can heal her. As the Alpha pack try to kill her, she shows her intense hatred for them. She reveals to Derek her first name was Julia Baccari and she was Kali's Emissary. She and Kali were close, but Kali had attempted to kill her, as part of killing her entire Pack in order to join the Alpha pack. She was able to survive because Kali couldn't bring herself to deliver the final blow. Julia then struggled to the Nemeton, which hadn't had power for a long time. But the sacrifice of a virgin months earlier had given the tree stump a spark of power again, which gave Julia the ability to survive just long enough until help arrived. Eventually, because Kali's attack had left Julia hideously disfigured, she used her talents to disguise herself with a new identity, 'Jennifer Blake'. She informs him of her plan to destroy Deucalion's Alpha Pack on the next full moon which is also a lunar eclipse because werewolves lose all their power during the eclipse. Derek affirms this. She also tells him the virgin sacrificed at the Nemeton that reignited its power was Paige Krasikeva, his first love when Derek mercy-killed her, explaining her felt connection towards him. In \"Alpha Pact\", Jennifer holds Stiles' father, along with Scott's mother and Allison's father for the final sacrifice, Guardians, as they are all Guardians of their children. The behavior of the animals throughout the season is later discovered to have been caused by Jennifer in response to her and her mass sacrifices. She is also discovered to be aligned with the telluric currents as she committed her sacrifices in line with them. She's holding the captive parents at the Nemeton, the same tree in Lydia's been consistently drawing which is why Jennifer tried to kill her."},{"id":"train-229909-129","text":"In \"Lunar Ellipse\", Jennifer appears at Derek's loft, breaking through the glass roof and takes on the Alpha Pack. She overpowers Kali and the twins. She angrily faces Kali, asking her what it takes for to look normal to spite Kali as she'd physically ruined her actual face. Jennifer demonstrates her power using telekinesis to have the glass shards rise and suspend. Kali stubbornly rages at her former friend and Jennifer ferociously rockets the glass shards into Kali's body, killing her former Alpha. The twins then take her on in their merged form but she snaps their neck inducing them into a coma. She uses Lydia to lure Derek back to his loft. She promises Derek the kidnapped parents if he will be her \"Guardian\", even after he informs her he's no longer an Alpha werewolf. Jennifer begins sacrificing the parents using the storm to bury them alive with her connection to the telluric currents. At the abandoned distillery outside of Beacon Hills, they face off against Deucalion who has Scott with him. Deucalion easily overpowers both of them, but, to buy more time, Scott blinds the \"Demon Wolf\" long enough for the lunar eclipse to arrive and the werewolves are rendered powerless. Jennifer assumes her true form and thrashes Deucalion. Derek convinces her to heal his blindness so he can see the results of his actions on her with the intent of him repenting her. However, this leaves Jennifer weakened as Derek had intended. Enraged, Jennifer repeatedly assaults Derek, but he endures her attacks just long enough for the lunar eclipse to pass. The lunar eclipse passes, but Jennifer protects herself with a mountain ash barrier, now fully intent on sacrificing the parents. To save them, Scott determinedly pushes through her barrier and eventually breaks it becoming a True Alpha. Scott says he'll kill her himself if she doesn't stop the storm, but Deucalion does it mortally wounding her. Jennifer survived Deucalion's slash to the throat, and was hoping the Nemeton would restore her health once more only to be stopped by Peter Hale. After revealing she knows all about his plan (killing Scott to steal his new Alpha status), Peter slashes her throat himself, killing her for good."},{"id":"train-229909-130","text":"Jennifer was highly intelligent, specializing in literature and mythology, as expected of a druid Emissary. She had an intense hatred for Deucalion's Alpha pack, specifically Kali as she was friends with her and Kali tried to kill her and she stopped at nothing to get revenge on them, to the point of sacrificing innocent people. As the Darach, Jennifer was amongst the most powerful beings seen in the series because of her mass druid sacrifices. By massacring Warriors, she gained enhanced strength, Healers for healing abilities so great she healed Deucalion's eyesight, Philosophers for intelligence and strategy, and Virgins, to seduce people easily for her agenda as with Derek. She could use telekinesis, a form of mind control to have a pianist killed by a split random cord off the piano to slit her throat for her final Philosopher sacrifice, she could appear somewhere else partially or teleport completely as seen when Lydia saw her materialize in a blaze in \"Motel California\" and when she abducted victims.

Three months later, upon being found by Derek and Scott, Cora and Boyd lost all control of their animal sides and escaped into the woods to kill. They were later subdued by Derek, with assistance from Scott, Isaac and Chris Argent. Eventually the sun rises and she and Boyd are rescued and Cora is reunited with her brother joining his Pack. Cora is impulsive, trigger-happy, short tempered, vengeful and tomboyish but she cares for those close to her. Like her older brother Derek, she gives death threats to people; of course, like her older brother, she has no intention of going through with them. In \"Currents\", when Deaton is kidnapped to be sacrificed by the Darach, Cora helps Scott's friends to find him deducing that Deaton is being held in the same bank she was locked in for three months, but she learns the Alphas have attacked Derek's loft and sabotaged the trap for them. Cora leaves with Stiles and Lydia to help her brother. After Boyd is killed by the Alphas, she breaks down in tears and cradles her close friend's body. Cora tries to avenge his death by killing Aiden, but fails to do so and is knocked out when Aiden strikes her in the head with a weight. She is saved by Scott and Ethan when they restrain Aiden. Her wound from the blow to her head Aiden gave her suddenly doesn't heal, she falls unconscious and is put in the hospital. She was later revealed to have also been poisoned by Jennifer with mistletoe for leverage against Derek. Derek saves her life by giving up his Alpha werewolf status using his pain transference to heal her.

Deucalion, however, realized he could see using his werewolf vision and savagely killed Marco in retaliation. In doing so he realized Alphas became stronger when they kill their own Betas. The entire experience corrupted Deucalion. Eventually, he killed the rest of his pack to add all of their powers to his own and lead fellow Alphas Kali and Ennis to do the same. Sometime after, he came across the twins (Aiden and Ethan) who were \"the bitches\" in a brutal Pack. Deucalion taught them how to control their merged form to fight back against their abusers and they joined him after killing their original Alpha. He pulled all five of them together to form an Alpha pack. He even had all the members kill their Emissaries, except for Marin, his own.

Deucalion's actual plan for Derek was to place him against Scott. To this end, after the battle between the Packs in \"Frayed\", Deucalion kills Ennis after he fails to heal himself, absorbing Ennis' power; he lies to Kali and the twins that Ennis died of his wounds, intending to have a vengeful, distraught Kali force Derek's decision to join the Alpha Pack. In \"Currents\", the reason for this is because Deucalion knows that Scott has the potential to become a True Alpha and wants to recruit Scott, not Derek. Deucalion's true intentions throughout Season 3 were to push Scott into a position to either join the Alpha Pack or have Scott kill somebody, destroying his True Alpha potential and eliminating Scott as a potential threat to him. He had Ethan and Aiden enroll in high school to seduce people close to Scott for leverage. When the new killer committing human sacrifices is revealed to be a Darach, Deucalion had his pack hunt it down. He targets the Darach because it used to be a druid who can call upon powers from sacrifices. After finding out that the Darach is Jennifer, Kali's old emissary, the Alpha Pack leader tried to have her killed. Scott later tearfully joins Deucalion's pack in \"The Overlooked\" in return for Deucalion's offer to help look for his kidnapped mother.

In \"Lunar Ellipse\", Deucalion and Scott face off against Jennifer and Derek (who Jennifer forced into helping him). Deucalion shifts into his Demon Wolf persona and overpowers both of them easily. He then tries to force Scott into killing Jennifer to become an Alpha, but Scott blinds him using flash bolts as he can see as a wolf. During the lunar eclipse, Deucalion temporarily loses his powers and Jennifer is to be able to defeat him. After being beaten to a pulp, Jennifer is tricked by Derek into healing Deucalion's normal eyesight to allow him to see her face and the result of his crimes on her but Jennifer is weakened because of this. After the lunar eclipse passes, Deucalion is in awe as Scott awakens his True Alpha abilities, breaking through Jennifer's mountain ash barrier. Deucalion saves Scott from becoming a killer by mortally wounding Jennifer, slashing her throat, subsequently stopping her from sacrificing the kidnapped parents.

In exchange, Deucalion says that he only wants Scott's eyes \"on the tips of (his) claws\". In \"Amplification\", Hayden is assigned to watch over Deucalion. The Alpha offhandedly lets her know Theo plans on siphoning the Beast's power using the garuda talons, but Theo's own Chimera frequency would reject the talons then kill him. He also gives her subtle advice on where her loyalties lie referring to the skirmish between Scott and Theo's Packs, giving her the resolve to leave Theo so she can be with Liam. In \"The Beast of Beacon Hills\", Deucalion proposes that a ruffled Theo trust him while revealing he'd has been playing them all along in that he'd let them take him hostage. Deucalion tells Theo the secret to stealing power is to \"take their pain, take their life, take their power\" which leads to Theo murdering Josh to siphon the latter's power to use the Dread Doctor mask to identify the Beast. He encourages Theo to align with Scott, saying he can't get to the Beast's host \u2013 Mason \u2013 without Scott's connection.

As the Alpha Pack leader, Deucalion possessed abilities greater than that of an average Alpha werewolf; he was able to command a Pack of exceptionally powerful Alphas with both fear and respect.

At home, Noshiko attempts to help her daughter regain control of her power using acupuncture. Unfortunately, she and Ken later see that Kira has involuntarily escaped into the night, and then that Kira's sword was found embedded in a deceased Chimera. Noshiko, enlightened, helps a frustrated Kira to read Valack's coded novel which uncovers suppressed memories. The elder kitsune advises Kira she can't read the novel because the story is confusing her Fox spirit. To solve this issue, Kira should read the book, but without following the story: read the book backwards.

Kira is appalled at her mother for even considering the option. Noshiko placates her daughter, saying if the Fox becomes too powerful it will consume Kira and there'll be nothing of her left, but if she becomes a skinwalker her daughter would be kept alive. Kira despondently asks her mom would she really leave her there. Noshiko is conflicted after this. After Kira destroys the Oni manifestation as the test, but the shifters declare Kira must stay with them, Noshiko changes her mind.

In \"Required Reading\", Theo sets about sabotaging and breaking the Pack apart; he takes advantage of Stiles and Malia's secrets in their relationship (Stiles' killing Donovan in self-defense, and Malia impulsively confiding in Theo, because of his coyote side, that the Desert Wolf caused her family's crash) and plants seeds of doubt in Scott regarding Kira due to her Kitsune Evolution. Theo then blackmails Stiles using Donovan's death into staying quiet about Theo killing a new Chimera, allegedly to save the former's life. He and Stiles form a forced partnership in \"Strange Frequencies\". He advises Stiles that Scott wouldn't be a True Alpha if he'd reject Stiles for killing in self-defense while successfully pulling Stiles under his influence. Theo is completely accepted by the Pack in \"Ouroboros\" after finding an abducted Liam and Hayden. The then uses the latter two's romance to his advantage, staging Hayden's slow lethal injection once she is declared a \"failure\", and planting the idea in Liam's head that the Bite could save her, knowing Scott would say no. Theo lies to Scott on how Donovan's death at Stiles' hands occurred falsifying Stiles had murdered him in a rage, effectively breaking apart his and Stiles' friendship. In \"Status Asthmaticus\", Theo shows his true colors and executes his plan to take Scott's Pack and True Alpha status for himself. HINmanipulates Liam to kill Scott (because only Liam can steal Scott's True Alpha status, allowing Theo to steal it himself afterwards) and forces Stiles to make a choice to save Scott or his dad. After Liam fails, Theo angrily comes back to kill Scott himself. Scott, weakened, tells Theo his Pack will never follow him because he is \"barely even human\". He kills Scott in a petty tantrum. Theo then uses a mind-meld on a kidnapped Lydia, rendering her catatonic, so to find the Nemeton where the deceased Chimeras are kept by Parrish, and succeeds. Using the blood of 'The Soldier', the Doctors' incubated Alpha werewolf, revives four Chimeras, Hayden, Corey, Tracy and Josh.

All the other Chimeras were only guinea pigs to perfect their experiment. Another requirement for the process to work was to kill off the failed Chimeras (\"Failure compromises the experiment pool\"). The Doctors also end their partnership with Theo, allowing him to use the Soldier's blood to revive several Chimeras to form his own Pack. With their work completed, the Doctors watch over and protect the Beast from discovery, covering up its carnage. They now want the Beast to remember itself in its previous life.

Theo however corners him and smooth-talks his way up to Corey, then subtly threatens the younger boy that he's going to follow Theo's orders because of his fear of dying again. Though unsettled, Corey timidly complies. In \"Codominance\", Corey continues to pursue Mason, but Mason tells Corey he's with Theo, \"the bad guys\". Corey reasons with Mason that there are no bad guys or good guys anymore. It's whether you are dead or alive and he wants to be alive. He asks Mason does he want to be alive with him. Mason falls for Corey's charm and the two boys kiss. Corey maintains his loyalty to Theo but he and Mason carry on their romance and trade information during the tension between the two Packs.

Unfortunately, Leafpool arrives too late to save Cinderpelt when the horde of badgers attack the ThunderClan camp, and continually expresses guilt because of her mentor's death throughout the rest of the series.[18] She and Crowfeather agree never to see each other again, though for the rest of the books they are both oddly tense whenever they meet on occasion. Leafpool becomes the new ThunderClan medicine cat in Sunset, and discovers that Brambleclaw is to be the new deputy in Greystripe's absence and that he and Squirrelflight are destined to be mates, as well as the fact that her mentor, Cinderpelt, has been reincarnated as one of Sorreltail's kits, Cinderheart.[13] Spottedleaf also reveals to her that Mothwing, the RiverClan medicine cat and Leafpool's friend, does not believe in StarClan, a result of Hawkfrost, her brother, tricking Mudfur into taking her as his apprentice and then openly sharing with her what truly happened. Leafpool is also featured in a play written by Victoria Holmes, titled After Sunset: We Need to Talk, in which she appears to have something to tell Crowfeather, but then denies it after Crowfeather confesses that he has taken a new mate, Nightcloud, in WindClan.[30]"},{"id":"train-224733-115","text":"Later, in The Sight, she takes Hollypaw as her apprentice, who later decides to quit and become a warrior instead, confessing that she only wanted to be a medicine cat because of the position it would give her.

Jayfeather is currently a full medicine cat in\nThunderClan. Initially, Jayfeather wanted to become a warrior, because he desired to be just as important as his littermates to the Clan and felt that the duties of a medicine cat were insignificant compared to the glories a warrior could experience. He began warrior training under his grandmother's cousin Brightheart, but soon tired of it. He did not receive much training and barely explored ThunderClan's territory. In a rebellious act, Jayfeather decides to explore himself. This led to him walking over a cliff in the middle of WindClan's territory and falling into the lake. Luckily, a WindClan patrol consisting of Crowfeather, Heatherpaw, Breezepaw, and Whitetail was nearby, but because of this, Jayfeather is afraid of water after his father, Crowfeather, pulls him out. Later, Spottedleaf persuaded him to become a medicine cat.

His superior sense of smell enables him to diagnose medicinal ailments instantly and from a great distance away, a trait that is obviously ideal for a medicine cat. Jayfeather is able to hear and smell cats approaching from a great distance, well before any other cat nearby. In addition to his heightened senses, Jayfeather was born with a form of extrasensory perception which enables him to read other cats' minds, as well as enter the dreams of other cats and listen in on their conversations with members of StarClan. It is shown in Outcast that this ability extends to cats who do not fall under the jurisdiction of StarClan, such as cats of the Tribe of Rushing Water.[31] Jayfeather's mind-reading abilities can be blocked, however, if the intended target is aware of his intention; Leafpool is aware of her son's ability and consciously damps her thoughts whenever she does not want him in her head.

He has stumbled upon a seemingly insignificant stick which inexplicably emanates the thoughts and feelings of past members of the Ancient Clans, who used to live by the lake long ago.[32] Many fans have claimed that he had a \"relationship\" with it[35] until he broke it deliberately in The Fourth Apprentice, after finding out that Rock had been lying to him.[28] Jayfeather feels he is on the verge of a great discovery, the implications of which have greater importance than StarClan. He is also aware of Cinderheart's reincarnation. Despite these pieces of knowledge, Jayfeather seems to care about his Clanmates and performs quite well as a medicine cat. Jayfeather has abilities that other medicine cats don't, such as walking in other cat's dreams. One of the first times he did this was when he followed Leafpool to the Moonpool and overheard her dream. Over the course of the series he has become more tolerant of his Clanmates and less irritable, mainly due to his liberal use of mind-reading and being able to sympathize with their thoughts.  It was revealed in Long Shadows that Squirrelflight is not his mother.[26] Prior to the release of Sunrise, it was rumoured Leafpool and Crowfeather are his parents because of the attitude and coloring. This is found true which leads to Hollyleaf's so-called \"death\" and during his naming ceremony, Leafpool felt a feeling of love to him, and, in The New Prophecy series, Leafpool and Crowfeather were alone together at one point when they ran off. He saves Firestar after he is attacked by a fox in \"The Fourth Apprentice,\" although it was too late and he lost another life. He follows Poppyfrost (heavily pregnant with Berrynose's kits, Cherrypaw and Molepaw) to the Moonpool when she wants to see Honeyfern again, and gets attacked by Breezepelt, but Honeyfern drives him and another cat from the Dark Forest (Brokenstar) away.

A pretty young WindClan apprentice named Heatherpaw convinces him to form a play Clan called DarkClan inside the underground tunnels, with the leader being Heatherpaw and the deputy being Lionblaze, under the assumed names Heatherstar and Lionclaw, respectively. Lionblaze unknowingly falls in love with her, and she falls in love with him. Hollyleaf and Cinderheart find out about the meetings, and Hollyleaf threatens to tell. Lionblaze hates her nosiness.

He was the son of Raggedstar and Yellowfang, but didn't know that the latter was his mother, who bore him and two she-kits (who died) in secret. He was given to an ambitious queen named Lizardstripe to be fostered instead. Lizardstripe would not accept Brokentail in her den when he was a kit, purely because he had a crooked tail.[56] Brokentail grew into a great warrior and eventually became deputy, but he murdered his own father, Raggedstar, so that he could become leader and exiled Yellowfang from ShadowClan, falsely accusing her of murdering two apprentices that he himself killed by forcing them into warrior training too soon. This banishment led to Yellowfang's acceptance into ThunderClan. In Into The Wild, when Brokenstar is first introduced, Yellowfang and Firepaw drove Brokenstar and his supporters out of ShadowClan in a revolt.[1]  Brokentail lived as a rogue in Fire and Ice, and attacked the ThunderClan camp in an attempt to kill Fireheart but was blinded by Yellowfang.[8] He was then taken prisoner and stripped of his leadership status, renamed to his old warrior name of Brokentail. He plotted with Tigerclaw in Forest of Secrets to attack ThunderClan along with his rogue allies, though the attack failed.[12] When the rogues were chased out and Tigerclaw was exiled, Yellowfang decided to end Brokentail's life by feeding him deathberries, also revealing to him that she was really his mother.

But in the prologue of Sunrise, as Leafpool is examining Ashfur's body, she finds a tuft of black fur carrying Hollyleaf's scent, identifying Hollyleaf as the real killer.[20]  However, the rest of the Clan does not know this, so Ashfoot, the WindClan deputy, reveals to Brambleclaw that she saw Sol near where Ashfur's body was found. Upon hearing this, Firestar sent a patrol consisting of Brambleclaw, Brackenfur, Birchfall, Hazeltail, Lionblaze, and Hollyleaf. They search a large Twolegplace near the sun-drown-place and find a group of cats that Sol convinced to fight a pack of wild dogs that were threatening their home. After hearing the horrific story of their defeat, the new leader, Jingo, leads them to Purdy as Sol is staying with him. They find him and take him to the ThunderClan camp to be questioned by Firestar, with Purdy tagging along, becoming a ThunderClan elder. After being interrogated by Firestar, Sol is kept as a prisoner, but escapes when he lures Lionblaze to help him out by telling him he knows who his real father is. When the rest of the Clan finds out, it is rather a relief, because the other Clans were threatening Firestar, as they were nervous at the fact that someone like Sol was among them. Therefore, Firestar just told the other Clans that he banished Sol."},{"id":"train-224733-420","text":"In \"The Forgotten Warrior\", Lionblaze finds Sol in the tunnels while trying to discover if Hollyleaf is dead or not.

Berrynose, Poppyfrost, and the younger cats accept him. The older cats do not trust him but, Firestar allows Sol to stay with them. Dovewing and Ivypool do not trust him and while in the tunnels, hear him plotting with some WindClan cats, planning to attack ThunderClan through the tunnels. Dovewing and Ivypool are almost caught by WindClan, but a cat saves them and reveals herself to be Hollyleaf. Lionblaze brings Hollyleaf to camp and she reveals that she is the one who saved Cherrypaw and Molepaw from the fox. Many cats, including Berrynose and Poppyfrost, grow furious with Sol and discover he has not returned to camp for a few days.

This is shown when he steals food from some foxes that live nearby, inadvertently leading them to the Clan's camp, which makes Leafstar, the leader of SkyClan, angry with him. In an attempt to impress her, Sol later steals Leafstar's three very young kits and hides them far away from the gorge so that he can play a heroic role in finding them. However, his plot is discovered and, in a rage, Leafstar exiles Sol from SkyClan, telling him that he can never be a true warrior because he is selfish and has no understanding of the Warrior Code at all.

While still heavily pregnant, Smoke wanted to join WindClan so that her kittens could be brought up as warriors (Onewhisker having never told her the harsher side of the Warrior life). Onewhisker refused, partly because it wasn't the life for her and partly because he knew he would be in terrible trouble for mating with a kittypet. The only one of her litter to survive was Darktail, and Onewhisker refused to let his son join WindClan for the same reason as his mother.

Frightened by this, Onestar orders his Clan to retreat. This costs the Clans the battle and leads to the deaths of several cats, and many others being severely wounded. Shortly afterwards, Darktail takes over RiverClan's territory. When the battle ends, Darktail refuses to allow RiverClan to treat their wounded Clanmates (instead taking them as prisoners), and to take their dead for burial, even callously dismissing them as \"carrion\".

The tumult on the Rand led directly to the first comprehensive piece of labour legislation, the Industrial Conciliation Act 1924, which was also the first legislation to regulate strikes in the country. It also recognised and regulated lock-outs. The Act provided for the registration of white trade unions and employers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 organisations, \"self-evidently also white,\"[76] and established a framework for collective bargaining through industrial councils or conciliation boards, as well as a dispute settlement system. Although the Act was \"largely voluntarist,\"[76] compliance with its provisions and with collective agreements was enforced by criminal sanction.

The Commission\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s comprehensive review led to legislation that had a far-reaching effect on the labour structure. Trade unions were racially divided, job reservation was introduced and blacks were precluded from joining registered trade unions.

As such, the common law did not concern itself directly with collective bargaining; its focus instead was on the rights and duties of individual employees and employers, as reflected in the contract on which their relationship was based.

In effect, employees who are not members of the trade union may derive benefits from a collective agreement entered into by a union. \"Understandably,\"[117] unions have reservations about this state of affairs. These non-union employees are sometimes called \"free riders,\" because they derive benefits for free: They do not pay union subscriptions, but they still obtain the benefits of the union\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s collective bargaining.

This they do by preventing the defection of members during wage bargaining which may lead to strike action.[119]"},{"id":"train-9252-764","text":"There may also be some benefit in such arrangements for the employer.
