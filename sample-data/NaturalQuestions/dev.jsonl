It was therefore possible to use a high-density drive to format a double-density disk to the higher capacity. This usually appeared to work (sometimes reporting a small number of bad sectors)\u2014at least for a time. The problem was that the high-density format was made possible by the creation of a new high-coercivity oxide coating (after soft-sector formatting became standard, previous increases in density were largely enabled by improvements in head technology; up until that point, the media formulation had essentially remained the same since 1976). In order to format or write to this high-coercivity media, the high-density drive switched its heads into a mode using a stronger magnetic field. When these stronger fields were written onto a double-density disk (having lower coercivity media), the strongly magnetized oxide particles would begin to affect the magnetic charge of adjacent particles. The net effect is that the disk would begin to erase itself. On the other hand, the opposite procedure (attempting to format an HD disk as DD) would fail almost every time, as the high-coercivity media would not retain data written by the low-power DD field. High-density 3\u00bd-inch disks avoided this problem by the addition of a hole in the disk cartridge so that the drive could determine the appropriate density. However, the coercivity rating between the 3\u00bd-inch DD and HD formats, 665 and 720 oersteds, is much narrower than that for the 5\u00bc-inch format, 600 versus 300 oersteds,[25] and consequently it was possible to format a 3\u00bd-inch DD disk as HD with no apparent problems."},{"id":"train-15236-22","text":"By the end of the 1980s, the 5\u00bc-inch disks had been superseded by the 3\u00bd-inch disks.

Nonetheless, in the season one episode \"No More Mr. Nice Guy\", Woodman is shown to be a gifted teacher, willing to wear historic costumes, and role-play in front of the class during his lessons."},{"id":"train-3025-6","text":"Vinnie Barbarino is a cocky Italian-American, the \"unofficial official\" leader and resident heartthrob of the Sweathogs. He has a need to be the center of attention, as seen when he admits to making it rain in the school gymnasium. In the two-episode \"Follow the Leader,\" Barbarino quits the Sweathogs and drops out of school in anger when Freddy Washington is chosen as the \"leader\" of the group, though he returns as leader at the finish of the story. Barbarino's prowess with women is a source of envy (and more often amusement) among his classmates. On occasion, he breaks out in song about his last name sung to the tune of Jan and Deans' song, \"Barbara Ann\". He was the first of the Sweathogs to move out on his own when he got a job as a hospital orderly. In the first episode of the series and fourth season, he has a girlfriend, Sally. Vinnie is Catholic (often describing his mother as a saint), and, as shown in \"I'm Having Their Baby\", is a Star Trek fan. Little is known about Vinnie's home life other than that his parents argue a lot (\"Follow the Leader (part 2)\") and take turns beating him when in a mutual rage. His mother's name is Margie (\"The Great Debate\"), and he shares a bed with his brother. The episode \"Don't Come Up And See Me Sometime\" implies that Vinnie is the older of the two. Travolta himself was a high school drop-out.[3]"},{"id":"train-3025-7","text":"The class clown of the Sweathogs, Arnold Horshack, is completely comfortable with his oddball, if na\u00c3\u00afve, personality. Horshack was known for his unique observations and his wheezing laugh, similar to that of a hyena. (Palillo revealed on a 1995 episode of The Jenny Jones Show that it originated from the way his father breathed during the last two weeks of his life as he lay dying from lung cancer.) It is possible that academically he is the smartest Sweathog. He is the only central Sweathog character to be promoted out of remedial academics class, but he soon returns after feeling out of place. He has an affection for acting and enjoys old movies, particularly 1930s musicals. He eventually marries Mary Johnson, a co-worker and fellow Sweathog. Although his surname sounds like a term for a bordello, he claimed it is a \"very old and respected name\" meaning \"the cattle are dying.\" His middle name (and his mother's maiden name) is \"Dingfelder.\""},{"id":"train-3025-8","text":"The hip, black student known as the athletic Sweathog for his skills on the basketball court, Washington claimed his nickname came from his habit of \"pretending to play the bass\" and singing \"Boom-boom-boom-boom!\". His trademark phrase is, \"Hi, there\" (spoken with a deep voice and a broad smile). Though often the voice of reason among his classmates, Washington nonetheless is a willing participant in the Sweathogs' various antics and pranks. Freddie also finds success as a radio disc jockey along with another former Sweathog, Wally \"The Wow\" (played by George Carlin). At one point, Washington challenges Barbarino for leadership of the Sweathogs, and even replaces him for a time until the group grows tired of his dictatorial style."},{"id":"train-3025-9","text":"Washington has an older sister, who got divorced twice while living in Vermont (\"The Longest Weekend\"), and a brother, Leroy. In \"The Great Debate\" it is revealed that he has another brother, Douglas, and that his father's name is Lincoln. Kotter uses his own past to bond with Freddie, because in addition to being a former Sweathog he was also a former star of Buchanan's basketball team."},{"id":"train-3025-10","text":"A fiercely proud Puerto Rican Jew (when asked if his mother was Puerto Rican, Juan replies that his mother's maiden name was Bibbermann and that his grandfather saw Puerto Rico from the ship as he was making his way to America and decided to settle there instead of Miami, making him one of the earliest Puerto Rican Jews; Juan is thus Puerto Rican on his father's side and Jewish on both parents' sides), Epstein is one of the toughest students at Buchanan High, despite his short stature. He normally walks with a tough-man strut, wears a red handkerchief hanging out of his right back pocket, and was voted \"Most Likely to Take a Life\" by his peers. In the season one episode, \"One of Our Sweathogs Is Missing\", Epstein was said to be the sixth of ten children (When speaking on the phone to his mother (who had failed to notice that he had been missing for three days), she apparently failed to recognize his name and he had to further identify himself as \"Number Six.\"), although he later mentions, in \"I'm Having Their Baby,\" that his mother only gave birth eight times, implying two of them were twin births. Only four of his siblings are mentioned by name: his brothers Pedro, Irving, and Sanchez (\"One of Our Sweathogs Is Missing\"), establishing that some of his siblings had Jewish names and others Puerto Rican names, and a younger sister, Carmen (\"A Love Story\"). Epstein's toughness was downplayed later on, and he became more of a wiseguy. He was also known to have a \"buddy\" relationship with Principal Lazarus as he often refers to him by his first name, Jack. On a few occasions, when Kotter did his Groucho Marx impersonation, Epstein would jump in and impersonate Chico Marx or Harpo Marx. Epstein's diminutive height, large hair, and fake excuse notes (always signed, \"Epstein's Mother\"), are common jokes associated with him."},{"id":"train-3025-11","text":"Rosie Totsie is the femme fatale purported to have put the \"sweat\" in Sweathog, though her reputation is largely exaggerated by the Sweathogs' word of mouth. Her promiscuity is at least in part a reaction to the strict discipline enforced by her father, the Reverend Totsie. To restore her good name, and to prove a point, she fabricates a story about one of the Sweathogs getting her pregnant. The character was a favorite among male viewers but was phased out of the series at the end of the first season when Scott was picked to co-star in the syndicated Norman Lear comedy, Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.[citation needed] She reprised the role in a 1978 episode, \"The Return of Hotsie Totsie\", in which it was revealed that she dropped out of school because she became pregnant and had to become a stripper to support her infant child."},{"id":"train-3025-12","text":"A recurring non-Sweathog character in the earlier seasons, Borden is a Straight A student and editor of the Buchanan Bugle, the school newspaper. She was Barbarino's tutor, and even dated him at one point. Despite her academic superiority, she can easily hold her own in a Dozens contest against any Sweathog."},{"id":"train-3025-13","text":"Introduced as a regular character in the fourth and final season, Beau is a handsome, friendly, blond, silver-tongued southerner who transfers from New Orleans after being kicked out of several other schools. He ends up in Kotter's class. The producers sought a heart throb who was not a direct knock-off of the \"Italian-Stallion\" trend that was permeating Hollywood in the mid-1970s who would improve ratings in the South where the show's New York setting was seen as unrelatable. They wanted to retain female viewers, but avoid a Travolta clone. Beau's first reaction to the term \"Sweathog\" is, \"That sounds gross.\" He seems to have a way with women, as shown in later episodes. One of his running jokes involves imparting whimsical sayings, such as one about how a real man never steps on a pregnant alligator."},{"id":"train-3025-14","text":"Welcome Back, Kotter's first season was controversial. In Boston, the local ABC affiliate (WCVB-TV) initially refused to air the show.[4] The city was going through a tumultuous school busing program that involved widespread protests and riots, and the local affiliate felt Kotter's fictional integrated classroom would only add fuel to the fire. However, the show became an early ratings success and the affiliate relented, picking it up from its fifth episode."},{"id":"train-3025-15","text":"Teachers in other cities had concerns about how Kotter would be portrayed, so producers allowed a union representative on the set to ensure the show protected the image of those in the profession. Kaplan opposed the idea, at one point asking a reporter if there was a junkman on the set of Sanford and Son to protect the reputation of junkmen.[citation needed]"},{"id":"train-3025-16","text":"Censor sentiments of Juvenile delinquency faded after the Sweathogs' antics proved to be silly rather than criminal. Like Kaplan, Hegyes was a fan of the Marx Brothers. Hegyes claimed that he suggested that the Sweathogs be modeled after the Marx Brothers in order to reduce tension.[5]"},{"id":"train-3025-17","text":"Ratings slipped greatly in the third season. Kaplan later attributed the decline to the age of the actors playing the Sweathogs, all then in their mid to late twenties, claiming that they were no longer believable as high school students. His idea was to have Kotter join the faculty of a community college attended by the Sweathogs;[6] however, this storyline never materialized. In order to increase viewership, the Kotters had twin girls, but this did not prove to be enough to regain the show's earlier momentum. The show introduced a female Sweathog, Angie Grabowski, played by Melonie Haller."},{"id":"train-3025-18","text":"Major changes took place in the fourth and final season."},{"id":"train-3025-19","text":"Shortly before the season began, the series was moved from its successful Thursday 8:00\u00a0pm time slot to Monday 8:00\u00a0pm to make way for the impending hit series Mork & Mindy."},{"id":"train-3025-20","text":"Virtually the entire writing staff was fired after season 3, and replaced with veteran writers from family-based series (such as Bob Claver from Leave It To Beaver and The Munsters)."},{"id":"train-3025-21","text":"Travolta, who had already starred in box office hits such as Grease, Saturday Night Fever, and Carrie, began to focus more time on his film career.

To help fill the voids, Stephen Shortridge joined the cast as smooth-talking Southerner Beau De LaBarre, and Kotter's wife, Julie, became a school secretary and occasional fill-in teacher, despite having one-year-old twin daughters."},{"id":"train-3025-24","text":"Knowing the series was in a nosedive, producer James Komack attempted to spin-off a newly married Arnold Horshack into a new sitcom (see section below).[citation needed]"},{"id":"train-3025-25","text":"The show enjoyed ratings success during its first two seasons, spawning a host of merchandising tie-ins including: lunch boxes, dolls, comic books, novels, and even a board game, advertised as \"The 'Up Your Nose With A Rubber Hose' Game\" in a commercial with a class full of Sweathog look-alikes featuring Steve Guttenberg as Barbarino.

There was also talk of developing a spin-off built around the Horshack character and his family, Rich Man, Poor Man; Horshack!, but it never went beyond the backdoor pilot stage, shown as an episode of Kotter.
