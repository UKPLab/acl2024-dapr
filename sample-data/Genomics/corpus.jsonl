And why use it to introduce an issue of the Journal highlighting the challenges of studying disease risks associated with low dose environmental exposures?\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-3","text":"In this issue, Lilienfeld describes John Snow giving expert-witness testimony on behalf of industry (1). Besides being interesting on a historical basis, this incident raises several issues that are pertinent today. Lilienfeld's paper and the accompanying commentary by Vandenbroucke (2) deal directly or indirectly with the role and responsibilities of expert witnesses, the extrapolation of data on health effects from high dose exposures to low dose exposures, the importance of epidemiology to the development of public health policy, the current debates on environmental justice (3), and the use of the precautionary principle (4) in standard-setting. Furthermore, if faced with an issue similar to that faced by Snow\u0097namely, local residents' being worried about health consequences associated with emanations from factories\u0097would modern-day environmental epidemiologists be any better positioned to carry out appropriate studies and reach sound conclusions?\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-4","text":"Snow can be seen at once as victim and perpetrator of sins that are common in epidemiology in general and in environmental epidemiology in particular. Was Snow victimized by the medical establishment, including The Lancet, for expressing views that were not commonly held by the scientists of the day? Were his peers outraged because of the reactionary social position he was taking (as suggested by Vandenbroucke)? On the other hand, was he as guilty as proponents of the miasma theory for trying to apply his theory of disease transmission to all situations without allowing for the possibility of multiple disease pathways? Did he fall into the trap of equating the absence of data with an absence of effect?\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-5","text":"When Snow contended that emanations from the bone-boiling factories were not causing ill health in the community at large, he invoked arguments that are often raised when unexpected health effects are encountered following supposed low dose exposures. One argument is that such health effects are implausible given what we know about high dose exposures. In this instance, Snow noted that the factory workers were not dying and therefore health effects in the community at large were not plausible. A related argument is that, even if workers are dying or suffering other health effects, because of the distance from the exposure source, the exposure levels in the community are probably too low to plausibly affect health.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-6","text":"Health effects of low dose exposures are often seen as implausible, even in the face of accumulated consistent evidence. Such arguments have frequently been invoked in environmental epidemiology. Examples of low dose exposures that have been deemed implausible contributors to disease risk based on what is known about high dose exposures include passive smoking, residential radon exposure, childhood lead exposure, electromagnetic fields, and residence near nuclear facilities. If one begins with a fixed idea of what is plausible, arguments regarding susceptible subgroups, inverse dose rate, hormesis, multiple pathways, multifactor etiologies, and complex exposures (e.g., the different constituents of sidestream and mainstream smoke) are untenable.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-7","text":"But how do we know that the factory workers were not dying or suffering other ill effects? Snow cited no studies. All too often the absence of data is argued as proof of no effect. This issue becomes especially difficult when regulatory decisions are being made. In the absence of evidence, can something be considered safe? While science is important, it is ultimately social forces, as much as science, that guide regulators in decision-making.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-8","text":"Snow's statements and the questions that were put to him call to mind some of the fundamental difficulties inherent in environmental epidemiology. Today, there are numerous examples of residents who live near potential environmental hazards claiming health effects that can never be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Although the \"gold standard\" is an unbiased risk estimate with precise confidence limits, studies focused on overt health effects are invariably underpowered because of the small numbers of residents in the neighborhoods of interest. Other creative approaches to assessment of subclinical health effects are more costly and difficult to implement, but even these studies are often too small for conclusive results. Yet, what is the right thing to do? If we wait for strong scientific evidence before we act\u0097if we require proof that workers are dying or evidence of overt illness in the community\u0097have we waited too long? Few clusters are ever resolved with the identification of a causal link between some localized exposure and disease. While many apparent clusters may be artifacts, what is the real cost of the true hazards that cannot be proven? These were the issues facing Parliament when Snow testified on behalf of industry.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-9","text":"What is the role of the epidemiologist in this quagmire? In Snow's London, the living conditions of people near the factories were likely to have been dismal. There were no doubt residents who perceived their symptoms as being related to the smells\u0097smells that, if nothing else, impacted the quality of life. Policy-makers must balance \"doing the right thing\" with regard to human suffering and quality of life with the financial costs of doing so. Epidemiology can only go so far in providing the answers.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-10","text":"It is this political and social tug-of-war that makes environmental epidemiology especially difficult. On the one hand, there are well\u0097funded industries with a financial stake in the outcome of such research. As Vandenbroucke notes (2), these industries often are in a position to exploit the many weaknesses that epidemiologists are trained to identify in their own studies and in the work of others to cast potentially damaging results in a more favorable light. On the other hand, there are environmental groups committed to proving that a particular environmental exposure can be linked to a variety of personal complaints; these groups may be motivated by the possibility of effecting social change through science or by the prospect of receiving needed medical attention or financial compensation. Those who attempt to work in this arena often find themselves and their research attacked from all directions.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-11","text":"Environmental epidemiology is difficult to conduct today for other reasons as well. Adequate tools with which to measure and quantify exposures are lacking. Studies are often unable to detect meaningful effects because exposures are low, infrequent, or difficult to measure with certainty. How many investigators are willing to tackle this problem? In the case of the bone-boiling factories, would research linking questionnaire data on symptoms to factory releases be believed? Would a study relating distance from the factory to disease be sufficient evidence of effect? What health effects would be plausible based on known biologic mechanisms? How well could those effects be measured, and could they be measured objectively? Is there a biomarker of exposure? If a biomarker exists, does it measure relevant past exposures? Is the measure unaffected by current health status\u0097particularly the disease under study?\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-12","text":"In addition to Lilienfeld's historical report and Vandenbroucke's commentary, this issue of the Journal features papers that illustrate various aspects of the difficulties faced in studying health effects of environmental exposures. Several of these include innovative attempts to improve the quality of such research.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-13","text":"The paper by Viel et al. (5) may come closest to what many may think of as environmental epidemiology. The authors have examined the spatial distribution of soft tissue sarcomas and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas around an incinerator with high dioxin emissions. Their results are suggestive but need to be followed by studies incorporating more rigorous exposure assessment\u0097perhaps a biologic measure of exposure such as that used in the study of polychlorinated biphenyls and breast cancer reported by Zheng et al. (6). Other studies described in this issue used a variety of approaches to exposure assessment. Rondeau et al. (7) linked estimates of levels of aluminum and silica in drinking water to risks of dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Laden et al. (8) used questionnaire data on use of electric blankets to estimate exposure to electromagnetic fields, and Gustavsson et al. (9) used questionnaire data and expert assessment by industrial hygienists to classify environmental and occupational exposures. Radiation workers are one of the few groups for which historical records of personal exposure typically are available. Dupree-Ellis et al. (10) took advantage of such records to estimate cumulative external radiation exposure.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-14","text":"Several of the papers evaluate methods for assessing exposure. For example, Oglesby et al. (11) average individual-level annoyance scores to estimate community-level exposure to air pollution. The authors propose that this measure better accounts for exposure variability than data from fixed-site monitoring stations. This is an interesting twist in a field where much work is based on linking data from monitoring stations with population-level mortality statistics. The measure seems to be easy to operationalize, and it correlates well with monitoring station data, although its ultimate utility may be limited. The real gold standard\u0097a more precise direct measure of individual exposure, rather than another indirect measure\u0097is what is needed. Hwang et al. (12) propose an alternative modeling approach whereby air pollution monitoring station data are used to ascribe exposures to individuals with and without school absences due to respiratory disease. Auvinen et al. (13) compare several possible methods for measuring and classifying exposure to electromagnetic fields. This is a topic that has been hurt by the lack of consensus on the best and most appropriate exposure measure, and results tend to vary for studies employing different exposure metrics. The paper by Karagas et al. (14) attempts to link a biologic measure, arsenic in toenails, with an environmental measure of arsenic in water. The toenail measure is likely to reflect total body burden, but it appears to correlate with water only when water levels are high. This presents an interesting regulatory dilemma. The best epidemiologic research may be based on a direct measure of body burden such as levels in toenails, whereas it is water levels that need to be regulated. Studies of toenail arsenic levels may not shed direct light on the link between water levels and disease.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-15","text":"As these papers demonstrate, technological advances are making possible a wide range of new study designs and strategies to better assess both exposures and outcomes. Although progress has been made, research in environmental epidemiology is far from perfect. As epidemiologists face pressures and criticisms from industry, regulatory bodies, and other scientific disciplines, it is important to not lose sight of the lessons from John Snow.\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-16","text":"NOTES\r\n"},{"id":"10901322-17","text":"Reprint requests to Dr. Dale P.

The reforms threatened the closure of many factories whose fumes were considered hazardous to the public's health. The second witness to appear before the Parliamentary committee considering the reforms was Dr. John Snow. Snow testified on behalf of the manufacturers threatened by the reforms. He stated that the fumes from such establishments were not hazardous. He contended that the workers in these factories did not become ill as a result of their exposures, and therefore these fumes could not be a hazard to the general public's health. Snow also presented data from the 1854 cholera outbreak as the basis for his belief that epidemic diseases were transmitted by water, not air. Although the data concerned cholera, Snow extended the inference to all epidemic diseases. When the committee's report was published, The Lancet chastised Snow in a stinging editorial. Parliament subsequently revised the bill in favor of the manufacturers and passed it into law. The implications of this particular episode in the history of epidemiology are discussed.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-4","text":"\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-5","text":"epidemiology; cholera; history of medicine, 19th cent.; legislation; public health\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-6","text":"John Snow is a celebrated figure in epidemiologic history (1\u00965). His formulation of an etiologic hypothesis for cholera and then testing of it in a natural experiment has been studied for at least eight decades. The lessons drawn from that work are still points of contention within the epidemiologic community (1). Yet many aspects of Snow's activities as an epidemiologist remain unclear. For example, although he was a prominent member of the Victorian medical community (e.g., President of the London Medical Society in 1855), Snow died in 1858 with little notice in either the medical or the popular press (4, 6). Some epidemiologists have viewed this absence as a reflection of Victorian England's attitude toward epidemiology, i.e., that epidemiology was not accorded much esteem (A. M. Lilienfeld, personal communication; P. Sartwell, personal communication) (4). Another common view is that the lack of comment regarding Snow's death was a response to his views on the etiology of cholera and his opposition to the miasma theory (4). The testimony that Snow gave to a Parliamentary Select Committee regarding a piece of pending legislation may provide some insights into Snow's etiologic theories and the apparent rejection of Snow in 1857\u00961858 by some members of the Victorian medical community.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-7","text":"BACKGROUND\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-8","text":"The 1850s were a vital period for public health efforts in Victorian England. During the 1840s, Edwin Chadwick and his colleagues orchestrated the passage by Parliament of several bills creating the General Board of Health and associated agencies charged with improving the public's health (3, 7, 8). Specifically, their actions were directed toward the elimination of epidemics, particularly cholera. By the early 1850s, Chadwick's brusque manner had alienated many of his supporters. The 1854 recurrence of cholera in England gave Chadwick's opponents an opportunity to reform the Board of Health into a weaker agency (8, 9). The Board's sole member, Sir Benjamin Hall (its President), immediately began a review of existing public health legislation (3, 8, 10).\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-9","text":"On January 23, 1855, in his capacity as President (and sole member) of the General Board of Health, Hall introduced a bill in Parliament, the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Amendments Bill, which sought to remove potential sources of disease in the environment (8, 11). Specific language referred to gas works, soap-boiling works, and similar establishments that would need to control\/reduce the degree to which they released fumes into the atmosphere. Local governments would be compelled to enforce the law. Some manufacturers would have to close to comply with it.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-10","text":"The bill underwent its first and second readings during the spring of 1855.

The committee, chaired by Sir Benjamin Hall, consisted of 12 additional members of Parliament. (Only Hall merited mention in the Dictionary of National Biography (13).) The committee heard from persons commenting on the bill, particularly those opposed to it, including manufacturers who would likely be put out of business if the bill became law (14). The committee report included all testimony, including that of John Snow, M.D. (14, pp. 311\u009668).

First, he provided expert testimony about epidemiology in a legislative setting. Second, he discussed his epidemiologic observations regarding the 1854 cholera outbreak. Third, he described his epidemiologic reasoning regarding the effect of \"offensive trades\" on health. Fourth, he presented his general theory on the etiology of epidemic diseases. Last, his testimony was condemned by a leading medical journal. Let us consider each of these aspects in turn.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-73","text":"The first notable aspect of Snow's testimony is that he provided it. At the outset, Snow indicated that he was testifying on behalf of some of the manufacturers who would be affected if the proposed bill were passed. (Among some present-day attorneys, an expert scientific witness is sometimes referred to as a \"hired gun.\") Specifically, he was approached by Mr. Knight, their attorney (who had been the first witness), and asked to testify on their behalf, as his views accorded with their own. We do not know whether Snow was paid to provide this testimony. It was not unusual for Victorian professionals to provide expert testimony in a legislative setting (17). Indeed, epidemiologists were called upon by Parliament during its deliberations on a bill mandating compulsory vaccination (18). Frequently, as in the controversy surrounding the purity of the water supply, such persons were found only in the employment of companies that would be affected by the proposed legislation. More recently, epidemiologists have provided testimony in both the legislative and judicial processes (18, 19). As Snow's example shows, even in Victorian times, interested parties would seek the testimony of persons, including epidemiologists, with views supportive of their stand.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-74","text":"Second, Snow discussed his studies on cholera during the 1854 epidemic. He used his 1854 studies as the basis for a general theory of the etiology of epidemic diseases. We do not know the specific limits of the term \"epidemic diseases.\" Smallpox was an epidemic disease in Victorian England, but it may not have been included in the term. In addition, the fact that Snow presented his data and conclusions to a lay audience with considerable influence in the formulation and implementation of Victorian public health policy means that the medical community was not the only one informed of Snow's findings. Moreover, the fact that Snow attended Queen Victoria to administer anesthesia during the birth of Princess Beatrice in 1857 suggests that Snow was accepted within Victorian society at least 2 years after providing this testimony (6).\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-75","text":"Indeed, Snow's work created enough interest in the potential role of water in the transmission of cholera that the General Board of Health undertook an investigation of the role of foul water in the development of cholera. In 1856, its Medical Officer, John Simon, in a published report of the Board, summarized its findings: \"Simply, it [the inquiry] asked whether in certain large populations, breathing the same atmosphere, comprehending the same classes, and averaging the same habits of life, the fatal disease [cholera] had been more prevalent among the drinkers of unclean water. The answer has been affirmative. The cholera mortality of the former class was more than three-fold that of the latter\" (20, p. 736). If Snow were considered to be at the fringe of the Victorian medical or public health communities, it is difficult to understand the analysis and publication by the General Board of Health of its data confirming Snow's hypothesis. Hence, one may conclude that John Snow was accepted and taken seriously in the Victorian medical and public health communities after publishing his work on cholera.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-76","text":"In his testimony, Snow was asked what the basis was for his view that the \"offensive trades\" posed no health risk. His response was that he had not observed such workers becoming ill from such exposure, and if the workers did not become ill, then the general population had little risk of becoming ill. Rather, the epidemic diseases that provided the popular support for the legislation were the result of exposure to the causal agent present in someone else with the disease. Snow also noted that these diseases were transmitted in a fecal-oral manner with minimal risk of aerosolized transmission. He did, however, acknowledge the possibility of some airborne transmission of a dried fleck of the causal agent. Snow did not qualify his reasoning to apply only to cholera. One must therefore conclude that he viewed fecal-oral transmission as the principal means of transmission of all epidemic diseases. Snow was a vegan and a teetotaler (6); one may speculate that he viewed the mouth and alimentary canal as the principal portals into the body and that he thought these were the only means by which an agent could gain access to a host.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-77","text":"Third, Snow described his epidemiologic reasoning regarding the effect of \"offensive trades\" on health. Snow suggested elsewhere that these trades were not hazardous: \"...whereas a bad smell cannot, simply because it is a bad smell, give rise to specific disease, so an offensive business conducted in a place where it ought not to be, should be proceeded against by ordinary law as a nuisance, without applying to it the word pestiferous, or otherwise dragging in and distorting the science of medicine\" (21, p. xxxix; also cited in Snow (6, p. 262)). Given that changes favorable to the manufacturers were made to the bill, one may conclude that his arguments were persuasive.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-78","text":"The fourth issue is Snow's general theory for the etiology of epidemic diseases. As noted above, the exact meaning of the term \"epidemic diseases\" is not known. Although Snow's data came from two cholera outbreaks (1849 and 1854), he did not qualify his answers regarding the causes of epidemic diseases generally and the lack of a possible role of fumes from offensive trades among such causes. For Snow, epidemic diseases, whether cholera or some other disorder, were transmitted from someone with that condition through a fecal-oral route. It is possible that Snow may have generalized beyond his data on cholera to consider this disease an exemplary condition. His arguments in favor of a general theory for the etiology of epidemic diseases were not the subject of many questions by the Committee. We do not know whether he considered this theory to be applicable to all diseases.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-79","text":"The final point is that Snow's testimony was condemned by a leading medical journal, The Lancet. The Lancet was a fixture of the Victorian medical community (22, 23). Its editor, Sir Thomas Wakley, was a pioneering journalist-physician known for his muckraking approach to Victorian medicine and health issues. These issues ranged from the appropriate care of a given patient to the purity of the London water supply to food adulteration. The Lancet was a key means by which information regarding the London Epidemiological Society's activities were made known to the Victorian medical community (24). Hence, Wakley's editorial against Snow's testimony was no small matter. Importantly, the Lancet did not contest Snow's conclusions regarding the role of water in the spread of cholera. Indeed, in 1851, the Lancet had published drawings of microscopic examinations of potable water used by Londoners; the drawings had much organic matter present, including animal \"productions\" known as \"animalculae\" (17, 25). Rather, Wakley thought that cleaning up the water supply was a needed action; he also thought that such actions were not sufficient for the prevention of disease (15). Although the Lancet published several of Snow's papers after he offered this testimony, it published an unusually short obituary about Snow when he died in 1858 (4, 6). The absence of a descriptive obituary for a former President of the London Medical Society is without explanation. One may speculate that Snow's work on cholera disgraced him in the eyes of the Victorian medical establishment and that his death was not commented on in the medical press in recognition of this state of affairs. However, such an explanation does not square with his attendance on Queen Victoria in 1857 or the report of the General Board of Health on the role of water in the transmission of cholera (6, 20). An alternative speculation is that his testimony, rather than his cholera work per se, disgraced Snow in the eyes of the Victorian medical press (or at least the Lancet) and that this was the reason for the absence of the obituary. The reference to his anesthesia work in that obituary, with no reference to his cholera work, is consistent with such speculation. Unfortunately, as is the nature of history in the absence of evidence, resolution of this issue is unlikely.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-80","text":"In conclusion, in 1855, John Snow provided epidemiologic testimony to a Parliamentary Select Committee considering the Nuisances Removal and Diseases Prevention Amendments Bill. This testimony was given on behalf of many of the manufacturers whose establishments would have been affected by the legislation. Snow contended that epidemic diseases were spread by contaminated water, not from foul odors emanating from the \"offensive trades.\" Publication of the Committee's report in June 1855 led to an editorial in the Lancet condemning Snow's testimony. The importance of this testimony and subsequent events have been considered, but a more definitive analysis awaits further data.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-81","text":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-82","text":"The author thanks Dr. Harry Marks for his encouragement and many helpful comments and Bert Black for his many suggestions.\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-83","text":"NOTES\r\n"},{"id":"10901323-84","text":"(Reprint requests to Dr. David E.

This apparently led to his starkly unwarranted generalization to factory fumes. Why was he so blind?\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-5","text":"There is a particular context. The year of the testimony was 1855: That was also the year in which John Snow published the second and much celebrated edition of his book on the contagiousness of cholera via drinking water (containing the story of the Broad Street pump), based on his experiences in the epidemics of the preceding years (2). Snow came out of his investigations an even more convinced adherent of the germ and contagion theory than he already was. As Dr. Lilienfeld explains, the 1854 Parliamentary acts were originally motivated by the same cholera epidemics. To Snow, it must have seemed like blasphemy that the proposed Parliamentary acts invoked the rival miasma theory (disease emanating by fumes), which he had, at least in his mind, completely proven wrong. To him, the idea of combatting the fumes must have seemed like the complete inverse of the lessons learned from the epidemics he had so thoroughly investigated. When I imagine myself in Snow's shoes\u0097i.e., having just published an account of some epidemiologic exposure and finding Parliament enacting laws completely contrary to my findings\u0097I feel anger mounting. What Snow obviously missed was the political understanding that these Parliamentary acts might have been provoked by the cholera epidemics but were aimed at much broader measures for improving living conditions.\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-6","text":"There is also a general context. In 1948, the medical historian Ackerknecht (3) described the great irony that around 1850 the academic popularity of the theory on germs and contagion was at an all-time low\u0097immediately preceding its most successful vindication by bacteriology. The germ and contagion theory was old, and it appealed (intuitively) to the ignorant masses but not to academics. Moreover, germs and contagion were in bad standing with merchants and industrialists. Contagionism had found its expression in quarantines. In the words of Ackerknecht: \"Quarantines meant, to the rapidly growing class of merchants and industrialists, a source of loss, a limitation to expansion, a weapon of bureaucratic control that it was no longer willing to tolerate...\" (3, p. 567). He went on to note that the liberal merchant class therefore sided with the enlightened theoreticians of the miasma theory. The latter group believed that one needs insight into time, place, and person to explain disease, and it led them to propose the cleaning of sewers, improvements in housing and nutrition, etc., instead of merely putting people in quarantine and not changing anything about their living conditions. Could it be\u0097just a historical guess\u0097that Snow seized the occasion to show the inverse, to ingratiate his theory with the wealthy and the powerful, by showing that his theory was not at all inimical to mercantile and industrial interests? Snow's opening words from the transcript published by Dr. Lilienfeld were: \"...my opinion is, that measures to protect the public health would not interfere with useful trades....\" (1, p. 5). On the contrary, in this instance, the theories on miasmatic fumes were contrary to those interests.\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-7","text":"The seemingly cold indifference of Snow to the plight of the laborers in the factories and the surrounding population exposed to toxic fumes contrasts strongly with several things he wrote in the second edition of his book on the propagation of cholera (2). For example, in the last pages of the book, he proposes measures to stop the spread of contagion. They read like an amalgam of the best of both theories (contagionism and the miasma theory): He proposes better housing, better sanitation, and measures for providing clean drinking water and preventing person-to-person transmission. From those pages, compassion seems to emanate for the poor as well as for immigrants.\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-8","text":"Beliefs and interpretation of data\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-9","text":"It is sometimes difficult to disentangle preconceived beliefs from data analysis and interpretation. Snow's work is a case at hand. I have previously demonstrated that he already held his germ-theory and drinking-water convictions before he made his observations, as can be seen from his earlier publications (4). More than that: When reading the second edition of his book, with its celebrated data on the Broad Street pump and the intermixing of water from different water companies, it becomes apparent that even his data analysis was guided by his preconceptions. Many tables giving the incidence of cholera by water company show data for the first weeks of the epidemic only. As Snow explained quite clearly, during the later weeks of the epidemic, cholera started to spread from person to person, and the difference between the water companies blurred. To us, nowadays, this is logic itself. To an adherent of the miasma theory at the time, however, this must have seemed like data-dredging (if the term existed then), since such an adherent believed neither in water contamination nor in person-to-person spread.\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-10","text":"\"Hired gun\"\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-11","text":"One can find Snow's attitude mirrored today. For instance, studies that report adverse consequences of pharmacologic preparations are often challenged on the basis of potential biases such as \"channeling,\" \"attrition of susceptibles,\" \"preferential prescribing,\" \"class effects,\" or \"confounding by indication.\" Such biases may be real, but they are often unproven or logically unfounded: They exist only as potential objections.\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-12","text":"The open discussion of such issues is important, but it is worrisome that these arguments seem to be raised most often by persons on the side of manufacturers with a financial stake in the outcome of these discussions. It is therefore extremely interesting to hear John Snow start his testimony with an argument often used by persons who testify on behalf of industry or other interest groups, one that goes more or less like: \"I was not lured into these opinions by lucre but was chosen because I already held these opinions.\" Certainly, that is often how things go. However, the selection for testimony of experts who are known to hold certain preconceived opinions is akin to publishing an unbalanced literature review, with potentially more serious consequences.\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-13","text":"Snow and his contemporaries\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-14","text":"The picture of Snow and his contemporaries remains complicated. The extent to which Snow's opinions on germ theory were accepted in his (short) lifetime or immediately thereafter remains difficult to judge. Certainly, there were people who referenced them, as is also demonstrated by Lilienfeld, and certainly quite a lot of people started to dream up combination theories that could cope with all objections (such as the concept that miasmas were also, or even sometimes preferentially, transported by water). However, Snow did not truly sway contemporary opinion, and his theories were not greeted as a complete breakthrough in the way that they are often presented as being in epidemiologic textbooks (4).\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-15","text":"Snow's relationship to The Lancet is even more difficult terrain. The Lancet's founder, Thomas Wakley, was officially the Editor from 1823 to 1862, but history has it that in 1851 he collapsed, exhausted from his medico-political fights, and retired temporarily to Madeira (5). His son, the even more irascible James Goodchild Wakley, joined the Lancet in 1852 and served as Editor from 1862 to 1886 (5). Thomas Wakley certainly leaned to the side of contagionism in the 1830s, but he remained critical (see below). Since Snow's first writings on cholera, along with the first edition of his book, were published in 1849, and the second edition of the book was published in 1855, a slow labor of love by a medical historian would be required for us to see whether the Lancet's editorial opinions about contagionism or about Snow in particular changed around 1852 when the younger Wakley moved in. (Ackerknecht suggests in a footnote (3, p. 581) that the contagionist Lancet was somehow already unfavorable to Snow in 1849, and hints that the Lancet softened its contagionist stand later on.)\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-16","text":"Perhaps, again, the Lancet's Editor saw the broader point that Snow so dearly missed. Even if the journal was siding with contagionism, the Editor might have seen that removing toxic fumes from factories was a good thing to do, whatever theory it was based on, and that it was politically rather foolish to cling so much to a single theory as to forget the greater good and have one's scientific reputation exploited by the manufacturers.\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-17","text":"Miasma and contagion\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-18","text":"The fundamental problem with the miasma and contagion theories at the time was that both failed to answer certain questions. This was already seen by Thomas Wakley in the 1830s (3). For instance, if disease came about by germs, why did not all persons attending the sick get sick? Most ironically, this argument can be turned backwards: If diseases come about by emanations from the soil, why do not all persons in the same household (including those attending the sick) get sick? However, do we, 150 years later, understand why certain persons develop disease\u0097for example, meningitis? That is, do we understand why people become ill preferentially after moving (e.g., army recruits coming together, schools starting after holidays, fugitives in camps); why the epidemics are more devastating amidst poverty and malnutrition; and, most enigmatically, why most contacts will remain only temporary carriers of the causative germ?\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-19","text":"The best historical judgment about Snow might follow the lines of the 1927 obituary on Charles Creighton that was written by Major Greenwood (the first professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine) (6). Creighton was a historical epidemiologist who had remained a complete anticontagionist well into the 20th century. Against all reason, he never believed in bacteria, out of conviction that bacteria alone could not explain why diseases occurred at certain times and places and among certain persons\u0097and he was therefore contemptuous of Snow (4). Nevertheless, Creighton wrote a factually most wonderful history of epidemics in Britain. Greenwood wrote about Creighton: \"He despised the pseudo-historian who awards praise or blame in accordance with the extent to which the opinions or descriptions of the old writer can be identified with those of modern idols of the market place\" (6, pp. 240\u00961). Perhaps this epitaph about an unreasonable anticontagionist might lead us to a measured retrospective judgment about the unreasonableness of Snow.\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-20","text":"NOTES\r\n"},{"id":"10901324-21","text":"Reprint requests to Dr. Jan P.
